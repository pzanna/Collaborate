# Eunice Research Platform v0.3.1 Comprehensive Test Specification

## Overview

This document provides a detailed specification for testing all components up to the completion of Version 0.3.1 of the Eunice Research Platform, designed for automated testing by GitHub Copilot Agent mode.

## Test Specification

### 1. Container Build and Deployment Testing

- **Dockerfile Verification:**
  - Validate syntax and build success for each service:
    - API Gateway
    - MCP Server
    - Database Service
    - AI Service
    - Research Manager Agent
    - Literature Search Agent
    - Screening & PRISMA Agent
    - Synthesis & Review Agent
    - Writer Agent
    - Planning Agent
    - Executor Agent
    - Memory Agent
    - Database Agent

- **Container Orchestration (Docker Compose):**
  - Execute `docker-compose up`.
  - Confirm containers start without errors.
  - Verify environment variables and inter-service dependencies.

---

### 2. Security Hardening and Vulnerability Testing

- **Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - Run automated vulnerability scans (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Docker Scout).
  - Validate no critical vulnerabilities are present.

- **Audit Logging:**
  - Check all services produce compliant logs for authentication events, RBAC authorization attempts, and system errors.

---

### 3. End-to-End MCP Implementation Testing

- **Agent Registration and Discovery:**
  - Verify agents correctly register with MCP Server.
  - Confirm MCP Server accurately maintains agent status.

- **Task Delegation and Response Handling:**
  - Execute tasks through MCP Server to each agent type.
  - Confirm correct routing and task completion notification.

- **AI Service Communication:**
  - Validate bidirectional MCP communication with AI Service.
  - Ensure AI requests route exclusively via MCP Server.

- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Test WebSocket connections from MCP Server to all agents.
  - Verify real-time task progress updates and notifications.

---

### 4. Communication Testing Between Services and Agents

- **API Gateway Interaction:**
  - Test routing of requests from UI to MCP Server.
  - Verify direct native PostgreSQL connection for read operations.
  - Confirm write operations route correctly via MCP to Database Service.

- **Agent-to-Agent Communication:**
  - Validate complex workflows orchestrated by the Research Manager Agent.
  - Check data integrity and consistency during multi-agent tasks.

- **File Storage and Database Interactions:**
  - Confirm Literature, Writer, Executor, and Memory Agents correctly access File Storage Service.
  - Verify agents properly persist and retrieve data from Database and Vector Database.

---

### 5. Performance and Load Testing

- **API Response Time:**
  - Validate API Gateway response times under load (<100ms target).

- **Agent Performance:**
  - Confirm literature search agent returns results within 5s under normal load conditions.
  - Execute concurrent multi-agent workflows to test system capacity.

- **Real-time Collaboration Latency:**
  - Verify WebSocket-based updates maintain latency <200ms.

- **Health Check and Monitoring:**
  - Test health check endpoints comprehensively.

---

## Testing Environment and Tools

- GitHub Copilot Agent for automated test execution.
- Docker for containerization and orchestration.
- OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Docker Scout for security scanning.
- Locust or similar for load and performance testing.

---

Ensure all testing is documented clearly, with results reviewed by the development and security teams before moving to production deployment.
