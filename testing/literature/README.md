# LiteratureAgent Test Suite

## Overview

This directory contains the consolidated test suite for the LiteratureAgent functionality. The LiteratureAgent provides comprehensive research capabilities including multi-engine web search, Semantic Scholar API integration, automated research workflows, and advanced content analysis. The tests have been streamlined to eliminate redundancy while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

## Files Structure

### Active Test Files

- **`test_literature_complete.py`** - Main comprehensive test suite

  - All functionality tests in one organized file
  - Can run with pytest or standalone
  - Includes basic, workflow, integration, and API tests

- **`run_tests.py`** - Unified test runner
  - Interactive menu for different test modes
  - Environment checking and validation
  - Replaces multiple separate test runners

### Documentation Files

- **`README.md`** - This file, explains the test structure
- **`WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation documentation

## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive test runner (recommended)
python tests/literature/run_tests.py

# Run all tests with pytest
python -m pytest tests/literature/test_literature_complete.py -v

# Run tests standalone
python tests/literature/test_literature_complete.py
```

### Test Categories

The test suite includes:

1. **Basic Functionality**

   - Search functionality
   - Content extraction
   - Error handling

2. **Workflow Functions**

   - Academic research workflow
   - Multi-source validation
   - Cost-optimized search
   - Comprehensive research pipeline
   - Fact verification workflow

3. **API Integration**

   - Semantic Scholar API
   - Multiple search engines
   - Fallback mechanisms

4. **System Integration**
   - MCP protocol integration
   - Configuration management
   - Agent lifecycle management

### Environment Setup

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pytest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your PYTHONPATH if running from project root:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Eunice/src
```

## Test Results

All tests are designed to:

- ✅ Pass without external API keys (using fallback mechanisms)
- ✅ Provide detailed output and logging
- ✅ Handle network failures gracefully
- ✅ Run quickly (typically under 60 seconds total)
- ✅ Work both with pytest and standalone execution

## Capabilities Tested

The test suite validates all LiteratureAgent capabilities:

- `search_information` - Multi-engine web search across Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Semantic Scholar
- `extract_web_content` - Advanced content extraction with metadata parsing
- `search_academic_papers` - Academic paper search with Semantic Scholar API integration and Google Scholar fallback
- `academic_research_workflow` - Complete academic research pipeline with filtering and ranking
- `multi_source_validation` - Cross-source information validation across multiple search engines
- `cost_optimized_search` - Budget-aware search strategies with configurable depth
- `comprehensive_research_pipeline` - Full research workflow combining web, academic, and news sources
- `fact_verification_workflow` - Comprehensive fact checking with credibility analysis and verification status

## Maintenance

This consolidated structure eliminates the need to maintain multiple test files with overlapping functionality. All future test additions should go into `test_literature_complete.py` following the existing patterns.

The test runner (`run_tests.py`) provides a user-friendly interface for different testing scenarios and can be extended as needed.
