# Development Plan - Three-Way AI Collaboration Application

## Immediate Next Steps

Based on your requirements for "basic functionality immediately," here's the prioritized development plan:

## Phase 1: MVP Implementation (This Week)

### Step 1: Environment Setup and Dependencies

**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

```bash
# Update requirements.txt with all needed dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create basic project structure
mkdir -p src/{core,models,storage,ai_clients,cli,config,utils}
mkdir -p tests data config logs exports
```

**Dependencies to add:**

- `pydantic` for data validation
- `click` for CLI interface
- `rich` for beautiful CLI formatting
- `aiosqlite` for async database operations
- `pyyaml` for configuration management
- `python-dotenv` for environment variables

### Step 2: Core Data Models

**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**

Create the fundamental data structures:

- Project model
- Conversation model  
- Message model
- AI Configuration model

### Step 3: Basic Storage Layer

**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 4-5 hours**

Implement SQLite-based storage with:

- Database initialization
- CRUD operations for all models
- Project-based conversation organization
- Data integrity constraints

### Step 4: AI Client Integration

**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 5-6 hours**

Create working AI clients for:

- OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini integration
- xAI Grok-3-mini integration
- Error handling and retry logic
- Token counting and cost tracking

### Step 5: Basic CLI Interface

**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 4-5 hours**

Implement minimal viable CLI:

- Start/resume conversations
- Send messages and receive responses
- Basic conversation display
- Configuration commands

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (Next Week)

### Step 6: Conversation Management

**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 6-8 hours**

- Conversation flow coordination
- Context sharing between AIs
- Message history management
- Auto-save functionality

### Step 7: Smart Response Logic

**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 4-6 hours**

- Implement recommended response strategy
- Both AIs respond by default
- Basic relevance filtering
- Context-aware role adaptation

### Step 8: Export System

**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**

- JSON export (structured data)
- Markdown export (readable format)
- Basic PDF export
- HTML export with styling

## Development Tasks Breakdown

### Immediate Tasks (Today/Tomorrow)

## Code Quality Standards

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for AI interactions
- CLI testing with mock responses
- Performance testing for large conversations

### Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling best practices

### Documentation

- API documentation
- User guide
- Configuration reference
- Troubleshooting guide

## Risk Mitigation

### API Cost Management

## Getting Started Checklist

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained
- [ ] xAI API key obtained
- [ ] Git repository initialized

### Setup Steps

1. [ ] Update requirements.txt
2. [ ] Create project structure
3. [ ] Set up configuration files
4. [ ] Initialize database schema
5. [ ] Create basic CLI entry point
6. [ ] Test AI API connections
