# API Cleanup Summary - Legacy Task Endpoints Removed ✅

## Overview

Successfully removed all legacy task-related endpoints from the v2 hierarchical API, keeping only the streamlined simplified research execution API.

## Backup Created

✅ **Backup saved**: `services/api-gateway/v2_hierarchical_api.py.backup`

- Original file: 1,943 lines
- Cleaned file: 1,568 lines  
- **Removed: 375 lines of legacy code**

## Legacy Endpoints Removed

### 🗑️ Task Management Endpoints (REMOVED)

- `POST /v2/plans/{plan_id}/tasks` - Create task
- `GET /v2/plans/{plan_id}/tasks` - List tasks for plan
- `GET /v2/tasks/{task_id}` - Get specific task
- `PUT /v2/tasks/{task_id}` - Update task
- `DELETE /v2/tasks/{task_id}` - Delete task

### 🗑️ Task Execution Endpoints (REMOVED)  

- `POST /v2/tasks/{task_id}/execute` - Execute individual task
- `POST /v2/tasks/{task_id}/cancel` - Cancel running task

### 🗑️ Unused Imports Removed

- `TaskRequest` - No longer needed
- `TaskUpdate` - No longer needed  
- `TaskResponse` - No longer needed

## Current Clean API Structure

### ✅ **Core Research Hierarchy**

- Projects → Topics → Plans → **Execute** (simplified)

### ✅ **Simplified Execution**

- `POST /v2/topics/{topic_id}/execute` - Single endpoint for all research execution
- `GET /v2/executions/{execution_id}/progress` - Progress tracking

### ✅ **Retained Endpoints**

- All project management endpoints
- All topic management endpoints  
- All plan management endpoints
- Enhanced statistics endpoints
- Progress tracking endpoints

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity**: 375 fewer lines of code to maintain
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Only one execution pathway  
3. **No Backward Compatibility Burden**: Clean break from legacy patterns
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Focused on simplified workflow
5. **Better User Experience**: Users only need to learn one execution API

## API Now Supports Only

### Modern Workflow

```
1. Create Project → 2. Create Topic → 3. Create Plan → 4. Approve Plan → 5. Execute Research
```

### Single Execution Endpoint

```json
POST /v2/topics/{topic_id}/execute
{
    "task_type": "literature_review",
    "depth": "masters"
}
```

## Files Affected

- ✅ **v2_hierarchical_api.py** - Legacy endpoints removed, imports cleaned
- ✅ **v2_hierarchical_api.py.backup** - Complete backup preserved
- ✅ **hierarchical_data_models.py** - Task models still available for other services
- ✅ **test_simplified_api.py** - Tests updated for simplified workflow only

## Validation

- ✅ File compiles without errors
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly
- ✅ Simplified execution endpoint functional
- ✅ Progress tracking endpoint functional
- ✅ No backward compatibility dependencies

---

**Status**: ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE - API now uses only the simplified execution pattern

The API is now clean, focused, and aligned with the "Make it so, number 2" simplified approach. No legacy task management complexity remains.
