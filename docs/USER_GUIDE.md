# Collaborate - Three-Way AI Collaboration Platform

## User Guide

Welcome to Collaborate, an intelligent three-way AI collaboration platform that enables productive conversations between you, OpenAI, and xAI. This guide will help you get started and make the most of the platform's advanced features.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Collaborate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export XAI_API_KEY="your-xai-api-key"

# Run the application
python collaborate.py
```

### 2. First Steps

1. **Create a Project**: Start by creating a project to organize your conversations
2. **Start a Conversation**: Begin your first three-way AI conversation
3. **Explore Smart Responses**: Experience intelligent AI response coordination
4. **Export Your Work**: Save your conversations in multiple formats

## Main Features

### 1. Project Management

**Create Projects**: Organize your conversations by topic or purpose
- Technical projects for coding discussions
- Creative projects for brainstorming
- Research projects for analysis and exploration

**Example**:
```
Project: "Web Development"
Description: "Discussions about modern web development practices"
```

### 2. Smart AI Conversations

**Intelligent Response Coordination**: The platform automatically determines which AI should respond based on:
- **Content Relevance**: Technical questions ‚Üí OpenAI, Creative questions ‚Üí xAI
- **Context Awareness**: Considers conversation history and topic
- **Direct Mentions**: Use `@openai` or `@xai` to address specific AIs
- **Balanced Participation**: Prevents one AI from dominating the conversation

**Example Conversation Flow**:
```
You: "I need help with a Python algorithm optimization"
‚Üí OpenAI responds (high technical relevance)

You: "Let's brainstorm creative solutions to this problem"
‚Üí xAI responds (high creative relevance)

You: "@openai what's your take on the performance?"
‚Üí OpenAI responds (direct mention)
```

### 3. Export System

**Multiple Formats Available**:
- **JSON**: Structured data for analysis
- **Markdown**: Human-readable format
- **HTML**: Web-ready format with styling
- **PDF**: Professional document format

**Export Options**:
- Single conversation export

## Menu Options

### Main Menu
1. **List Projects**: View all your projects
2. **Create Project**: Start a new project
3. **List Conversations**: View all conversations
4. **Start Conversation**: Begin a new conversation
5. **Resume Conversation**: Continue an existing conversation

### Smart Response Configuration

**Response Threshold** (0.0 - 1.0):
- Lower values = More AI responses
- Higher values = Fewer, more relevant responses
- Default: 0.3

**Max Consecutive Responses** (1-10):
- Prevents one AI from dominating
- Ensures balanced participation
- Default: 3

## Best Practices

### 1. Effective Communication

**Be Specific**: Clear, specific questions get better responses
```
‚ùå "Help me with code"
‚úÖ "Help me optimize this Python sorting algorithm for large datasets"
```

**Use Context**: Provide relevant background information
```
‚úÖ "I'm building a web app with React and need help with state management"
```

**Direct When Needed**: Use @mentions for specific expertise
```
‚úÖ "@openai can you review this code for bugs?"
‚úÖ "@xai what are some creative alternatives to this approach?"
```

### 2. Project Organization

**Logical Grouping**: Group related conversations
- Technical projects for coding
- Creative projects for brainstorming
- Research projects for analysis

**Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names
```
‚úÖ "E-commerce Backend Development"
‚úÖ "Marketing Campaign Ideas"
‚úÖ "Data Analysis Best Practices"
```

### 3. Conversation Management

**Regular Exports**: Save important conversations
- Export at project milestones
- Create backups of valuable discussions
- Share insights with team members

**Review Statistics**: Monitor AI participation
- Check response balance
- Identify conversation patterns
- Optimize your question approach

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Customizing AI Behavior

**Adjust Response Sensitivity**:
- Lower threshold (0.1-0.2): More AI participation
- Higher threshold (0.5-0.8): Only highly relevant responses
- Balanced setting (0.3): Recommended for most use cases

**Control Conversation Flow**:
- Use direct mentions for specific expertise
