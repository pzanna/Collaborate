Key Changes to System Prompts
Problems with Your Original Prompts:

Artificial personality enforcement: "You are OpenAI" creates fake identity
Rigid conversation rules: 5-step processes that sound robotic
Forced coordination: "@xai, could you expand on..." feels scripted
Artificial differentiation: Making AIs act differently when they should just be themselves
Complex instructions: Too many rules that fight natural conversation flow

New Natural Approach:

Be yourself: No fake identities or forced personalities
Natural responses: Just be helpful and conversational
Organic references: Only mention others when it naturally makes sense
Flexible length: 2-4 sentences as a guideline, not a rule
Value-focused: Focus on adding value, not following scripts

Configuration Migration
Replace your current default_config.yaml with the simplified version, and update your config handling to:

Remove artificial rules from system prompts
Add simple coordination settings to config
Use the same base prompt for all AIs (they'll be naturally different)
Focus on helpfulness rather than role-playing

Why This Works Better
The original prompts were trying to create artificial personas and conversation patterns that actually made the conversation feel less natural. Real group conversations work because:

People respond when they have something valuable to add
They reference others naturally when relevant
They don't follow rigid conversation scripts
They're themselves, not playing roles

Your AIs will naturally be different due to their training, without forcing artificial personalities on them.
Would you like me to help you implement this configuration change, or do you have questions about how this affects the overall conversation flow?
