## 🚀 Next Steps: Continuing Phase 2

### 1. ⏳ Enhanced MCP Server Capabilities with Load Balancing

**Current State:** Basic MCP server exists in `src/mcp/`
**Required Enhancements:**

- Load balancing for agent requests
- Agent health monitoring and failover
- Enhanced service discovery
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Request queuing and rate limiting

### 2. ⏳ API Gateway Separation and Enhancement

**Current State:** API exists in `src/api/`
**Required Enhancements:**

- Separate API Gateway service
- Request routing and authentication
- Rate limiting and security enforcement
- API versioning and documentation
- Integration with Database and AI Agent services

### 3. ⏳ Task Queue Implementation (Celery/RQ)

**Current State:** Not implemented
**Required Features:**

- Asynchronous task processing
- Background job management
- Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Task monitoring and status tracking
- Integration with existing agent services

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Priority 1: MCP Server Enhancement

1. **Agent Registry System**
   - Dynamic agent registration and discovery
   - Health check mechanisms
   - Failover and load balancing logic

2. **Enhanced Protocol Features**
   - Request queuing and prioritization
   - Performance monitoring
   - Circuit breaker patterns

### Priority 2: API Gateway Refactoring

1. **Service Separation**
   - Extract gateway logic from current API
   - Implement service routing
   - Add authentication and authorization

2. **Integration Layer**
   - Connect to Database Agent service
   - Connect to AI Agent service
   - Implement caching and performance optimization

### Priority 3: Task Queue System

1. **Queue Infrastructure**
   - Choose between Celery/RQ based on requirements
   - Set up Redis/RabbitMQ as message broker
   - Implement worker processes

2. **Agent Integration**
   - Modify agents to support async task processing
   - Implement task status tracking
   - Add retry and error handling mechanisms

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Task Queue Choice:** Celery vs RQ vs custom implementation
2. **Message Broker:** Redis vs RabbitMQ vs in-memory queue
3. **Load Balancing Strategy:** Round-robin vs weighted vs least-connections
4. **Service Discovery:** DNS-based vs registry-based vs configuration-driven

## 📈 Success Metrics
