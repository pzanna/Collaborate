### Version 0.3

Microservices Transition (🎯 READY TO START)signed as a distributed, modular system that integrates user-facing interfaces, research agents, AI models, personas, and data storage systems through a **microservices and agent-oriented architecture**. At its core, the platform leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to coordinate communication and workflows between agents and tools

![Eunice](Logical_Design.jpeg)

The platform organises research work hierarchically:

**Project → Research Topic → Plan → Tasks**

This structure enables intuitive navigation and clear separation of concerns.

### Updated System Flow

1. **User Interaction**

   - Users interact via the **Web UI (React)**.
   - UI requests go through **FastAPI endpoints**, acting as the gateway for all system calls.

2. **API Gateway (FastAPI)**

   - Single entry point for UI requests and external integrations.
   - Routes read-only queries for high-frequency UI tasks directly to the database (with caching) for performance.
   - Routes complex, write, or orchestration requests directly to the **MCP Server**.

3. **Research Manager**

   - Orchestrates workflows, plans, and task delegation as a specialized agent within the MCP ecosystem.
   - Coordinates multi-agent workflows and manages task execution lifecycles.
   - Logs and monitors task execution and ensures system consistency.
   - Operates as an abstracted service, invoked by the MCP Server when orchestration is needed.

4. **MCP Server**

   - Core control plane for agent registration, service discovery, and routing.
   - Offers load balancing, monitoring, configuration management, and real-time WebSocket-based communication.
   - Enforces structured message formats, error handling, and secure communication.

#### MCP Protocol Specifications

**Core Communication Principle:**

🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL RULE**: All agents must communicate with AI providers EXCLUSIVELY through the MCP Server. Direct AI provider access by agents is strictly prohibited. This ensures centralized AI usage monitoring, cost control, security, and consistent error handling.

**Message Types:**

- `research_request`: Task initiation from Research Manager
- `agent_response`: Results from specialized agents
- `ai_request`: AI provider requests routed through MCP Server only
- `ai_response`: AI provider responses delivered via MCP Server
- `persona_consultation`: Expert domain queries
- `resource_allocation`: Cost and usage tracking
- `agent_registration`: New agent joining the system
- `health_check`: Agent availability monitoring

**Communication Patterns:**

- Request-Response: Synchronous task execution
- AI Communication: All AI requests flow through MCP Server → AI Service → AI Provider
- Publish-Subscribe: Real-time updates and notifications
- Event Streaming: Audit logging and monitoring

**AI Communication Restrictions:**

- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Direct API calls from agents to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any AI provider
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Agent-level API key configuration or storage
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Fallback mechanisms that bypass MCP for AI access
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Mock data or hardcoded responses in agent capabilities
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Direct HTTP endpoints that bypass MCP protocol (except health check API)
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: All AI requests via MCP `ai_request` message type

- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Fallback to mock responses when AI services are unavailable
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Cost estimation using static hardcoded values
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Information analysis with predetermined responses
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: All agent responses must be AI-generated via MCP
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Graceful error handling when AI services unavailable (return errors, not mock data)
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Mock data only permitted in dedicated test environments with clear labeling

**Error Handling:**

- Circuit breaker patterns for agent failures
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation when agents are unavailable
- Dead letter queues for failed messages

**Security Features:**

- Message encryption and authentication
- Capability-based authorization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for compliance

5. **Database Agent**

   - Encapsulates all database **write** operations.
   - Exposes an API that shields other components from schema changes.

6. **AI Agent**

   - Abstracts access to AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, local LLMs).
   - Supports NLP, reasoning, and data analysis with retry logic and model fallback.

7. **Tools and Research Agents**

   - Tools are deterministic functions (e.g., data extraction, scraping).
   - Research Agents handle domain-specific reasoning, planning, and execution.

8. **Data Storage**

   - **PostgreSQL** for structured project and task data.
   - **Memory Cache** for high-speed data access.

#### Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Single Agent Mode**: 60% cost reduction by using single agent instead of multi-agent approach
- **Complexity Reduction**: Query optimization to reduce complexity scoring and multipliers
- **Token Management**: Efficient prompt design and context sharing between agents
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar operations to minimize API calls
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reuse previous results and responses when applicable

#### Implementation Guidelines

- **Planning Agent**: Primary cost estimation via `cost_estimator.py` module
- **Frontend Integration**: Interactive cost breakdown dialogs with real-time updates
- **API Endpoints**: Dedicated cost estimation, tracking, and optimization endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized cost settings, thresholds, and provider pricing
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Session and daily cost limits with automated warnings

## Architecture Guidelines for Developers

- Each agent/microservice must expose a stable API.
- Follow interface-driven design with Pydantic.
- Implement retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers.
- Trace tasks with correlation IDs.
- **MANDATORY**: All agents must implement ONLY a health check API endpoint (`/health`, `/status`, or `/healthz`)
- **MANDATORY**: No business logic APIs - all operations via MCP protocol exclusively
- **MANDATORY**: Health check must return agent status, version, uptime, and readiness information

---

## Future Enhancements

- Migration  to Postgres.
- Event-driven architecture using Kafka/NATS.
- Integration of vector databases for semantic search.
- Edge AI for low-latency inference.
- **Knowledge Base** for research documents, literature results, and findings.
- Introduction of a dedicated **Data Agent Service** with replication and failover.
- Adoption of a **message bus/event streaming platform** (e.g., Apache Kafka or NATS JetStream).
- Automated scaling with **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for agents and services.
- Integration of **vector embeddings search engines** for advanced semantic search (e.g., Weaviate, Milvus).
- Deployment of **edge AI models** closer to the user interface for reduced latency.
- Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring and reporting.
- Structured JSON logging.
- Implements **JWT-based authentication, authorisation, and rate limiting**.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions for user access.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions at the MCP server and API gateway levels.
- Multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud support for improved resilience.

## Version 0.2 Implementation Summary (July 2025)

### � Overview

**Version 0.2: Service Extraction** has been successfully completed, transforming the Eunice Research Platform into a modern, scalable microservices architecture. All three major components have been implemented and tested:

#### ✅ Enhanced MCP Server Capabilities with Load Balancing

**Implementation**: `/src/mcp/server.py`, `/src/mcp/load_balancer.py`

- **5 Load Balancing Strategies**: Round-robin, weighted round-robin, least connections, IP hash, random selection
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Automatic failover and recovery for agent failures  
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and agent health tracking
- **Structured Logging**: Dual logging system (`mcp_server.log`, `mcp_tasks.log`) with proper log separation
- **Enterprise Features**: Connection pooling, request timeout handling, graceful shutdown

#### ✅ API Gateway Separation and Enhancement

**Implementation**: `/src/api/gateway.py`, `/start_api_gateway.py`

- **Unified REST Interface**: 13+ endpoints for literature search, research tasks, data analysis
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless communication with MCP server via ResearchAction objects
- **Auto-Generated Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when MCP server unavailable
- **Queue Integration**: Enhanced with 8 additional queue-specific endpoints

#### ✅ Task Queue Implementation (Redis Queue)

**Implementation**: `/src/queue/`, `/start_worker.py`

- **Redis Queue Infrastructure**: 6 specialized queues (high_priority, literature, analysis, planning, memory, default)
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Background processing for literature search, research planning, data analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time job status updates with metadata and progress indicators
- **Worker Scaling**: Horizontal scaling support for processing capacity
- **Job Management**: Cancel, retry, cleanup operations with comprehensive monitoring
