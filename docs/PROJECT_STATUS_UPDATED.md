## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues

### **Known Issues**

- None currently identified

### **Technical Debt**

- Legacy SimplifiedCoordinator will be removed after Phase 4
- Database schema needs updates for research tasks
- Frontend components need research mode implementation

### **Risk Mitigation**

- Keep existing system running until replacement is complete
- Implement comprehensive testing before go-live
- Plan rollback strategy if issues arise

## 📝 Design Changes & Decisions

### **18 July 2025**

- **Decision**: Completed Phase 2 ahead of schedule
- **Rationale**: Research Manager implementation was more straightforward than expected
- **Impact**: Phase 3 can start immediately, potentially finishing project early

### **Pending Decisions**

- Search API provider selection (DuckDuckGo vs alternatives)
- Agent failure handling strategy
- Context persistence approach
- Security model for web scraping

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

### **Development Environment**

- Local development with all services running via start_web.sh
- SQLite database for persistence
- Chrome/Chromium for web scraping

### **Production Considerations**

- MCP server as system service
- Rate limiting for search APIs
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Monitoring and alerting system
