# Collaborate Project - Architecture Documentation

# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Collaborate project, detailing the components, their interactions, and the overall design principles.

## System Architecture

![Architecture](Architecture.jpg)

The Collaborate system is designed to facilitate collaborative research and data analysis through a modular architecture. It leverages microservices, APIs, and a robust frontend to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining high performance and reliability.

- **Frontend**: User interface for interaction with the system.
- **Backend**: Core logic and processing engine.
- **Database**: Persistent storage for user data, research workflows, and system logs.
- **Agents**: Specialized components that perform specific tasks such as data retrieval, analysis, and reporting.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Tools for tracking system performance and debugging issues.
- **APIs**: Interfaces for communication between frontend, backend, and external services.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Developed using Python with FastAPI, handling requests and orchestrating agent interactions.
- **Database**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for structured data storage, with Redis for caching and session management.
- **Agents**: Implemented as microservices, allowing for independent scaling and deployment.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrated with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring, and ELK stack for logging and analysis.
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for communication, with GraphQL support for flexible queries.
