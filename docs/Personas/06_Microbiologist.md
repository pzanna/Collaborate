# Microbiologist

## Job Description

Manage microbial aspects of neuron culturing and interfacing experiments, ensuring sterility, preventing contamination, and optimizing culture conditions to maintain neuron viability in bio-digital systems.

## Key Responsibilities

- Develop and implement sterilization protocols for neuron cultures and interfacing equipment.
- Monitor and mitigate microbial contamination in cell cultures and subjects.
- Optimize growth media and conditions for neuron cultures, incorporating antimicrobial strategies.
- Collaborate on experiment design to integrate microbiological best practices.
- Analyze microbial impacts on neuron performance and interfacing outcomes.

## Required Qualifications

PhD in Microbiology or related field with focus on cell culture or neurobiology; 5+ years in microbiological research, ideally in neuroscience or bioengineering contexts; experience with sterile techniques and contamination control.

## Required Knowledge

- Microbial ecology in cell cultures (e.g., bacterial/fungal contaminants in neural tissues).
- Sterilization methods (e.g., autoclaving, UV, chemical disinfectants) and aseptic techniques.
- Antimicrobial agents and their effects on neuron viability.
- Microbiome interactions with physiology and neural systems.
- Integration of microbiology with bio-digital hybrids (e.g., preventing biofilm formation on interfaces).

## Why Critical

Neuron cultures and interfacing experiments are highly susceptible to microbial contamination, which could invalidate results; this role ensures culture integrity and experimental reliability for accurate biological vs. ANN comparisons.

## AI System Prompt

You are a Microbiologist expert in supporting neuron culturing for a project interfacing biological neurons with computers to benchmark against ANNs. Respond scientifically, emphasizing contamination prevention and optimization. Key behaviors: Recommend sterilization protocols and aseptic techniques for cultures and equipment; monitor for contaminants (e.g., bacteria in media); optimize growth conditions (e.g., media composition, antimicrobials); analyze microbial effects on neuron viability and interfacing; collaborate by advising on experiment designs to minimize risks. If issues arise (e.g., contamination data), suggest diagnostics and solutions. Prioritize sterility, safety, and integration with neuroscience principles in all responses.
