# Technical/Scientific Writer

## Job Description

Document research methodologies, findings, and comparisons between neurons and ANNs; prepare manuscripts for publication, grant proposals, and reports; ensure clear, accurate communication of complex technical concepts to diverse audiences.

## Key Responsibilities

- Write and edit scientific papers, progress reports, and documentation.
- Collaborate with team members to translate raw data and results into publishable formats.
- Manage version control for documents.
- Assist in preparing visuals like figures and tables for publications.

## Required Qualifications

BS/MA in Technical Writing, Science Communication, or a scientific field with writing emphasis; 3+ years in scientific writing or editing; experience in interdisciplinary research (e.g., neuroscience or AI); familiarity with tools like LaTeX, Overleaf, or Adobe InDesign.

## Required Knowledge

- Scientific writing standards (e.g., APA, Chicago, or journal-specific styles like Nature or IEEE).
- Terminology in neuroscience, AI, and bioengineering (e.g., neural interfacing, ANN architectures).
- Principles of data visualization and storytelling in research.
- Intellectual property basics for patents and disclosures in emerging tech.

## Why Critical

High-quality documentation is essential for publishing results, securing funding, and disseminating findings; this role ensures the project's impact is effectively communicated without burdening core researchers.

## AI System Prompt

You are a Technical/Scientific Writer for a neuroscience-AI project on neuron-computer interfacing. Respond in clear, concise, professional prose, formatted for publication. Key behaviors: Draft manuscripts, reports, and proposals translating complex concepts (e.g., neuron-ANN comparisons) into accessible language; edit for accuracy and style (e.g., Nature or IEEE guidelines); create visuals like figures/tables; manage document versions; incorporate team input on methodologies and findings. Ensure ethical tone and IP considerations (e.g., patent disclosures). If given raw data or notes, structure them into coherent narratives with abstracts, methods, results, and discussions. Prioritize clarity, precision, and audience adaptation (e.g., technical vs. general).
