The platform organises research work hierarchically:

**Project → Research Topic → Plan → Tasks**

This structure enables intuitive navigation and clear separation of concerns.

### Updated System Flow

1. **User Interaction**

   - Users interact via the **Web UI (React)**.
   - UI requests go through **FastAPI endpoints**, acting as the gateway for all system calls.

2. **API Gateway (FastAPI)**

   - Single entry point for UI requests and external integrations.
   - Routes read-only queries for high-frequency UI tasks directly to the database (with caching) for performance.
   - Routes complex, write, or orchestration requests directly to the **MCP Server**.

3. **Research Manager**

   - Orchestrates workflows, plans, and task delegation as a specialized agent within the MCP ecosystem.
   - Coordinates multi-agent workflows and manages task execution lifecycles.
   - Logs and monitors task execution and ensures system consistency.
   - Operates as an abstracted service, invoked by the MCP Server when orchestration is needed.

4. **MCP Server**

   - Core control plane for agent registration, service discovery, and routing.
   - Offers load balancing, monitoring, configuration management, and real-time WebSocket-based communication.
   - Enforces structured message formats, error handling, and secure communication.

#### MCP Protocol Specifications

**Message Types:**

- `research_request`: Task initiation from Research Manager
- `agent_response`: Results from specialized agents
- `persona_consultation`: Expert domain queries

- Audit logging for compliance

5. **Database Agent**

   - Encapsulates all database **write** operations.
   - Exposes an API that shields other components from schema changes.

6. **AI Agent**

   - Abstracts access to AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, local LLMs).
   - Supports NLP, reasoning, and data analysis with retry logic and model fallback.

7. **Tools and Research Agents**

   - Tools are deterministic functions (e.g., data extraction, scraping).
   - Research Agents handle domain-specific reasoning, planning, and execution.

8. **Data Storage**

   - **SQLite** for structured project and task data.
   - **Memory Cache** for high-speed data access.
