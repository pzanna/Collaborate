# Hierarchical Research Structure

## Overview

The Eunice research platform uses a clear, hierarchical structure for organizing research work, implemented through **standardized services** with consistent patterns:

**_Project → Research Topic → Research Plan → Task_**

Each research project contains multiple topics, each topic contains one or more research plans, and each plan is made up of individual tasks. This hierarchy ensures a logical flow from broad initiatives down to actionable work items.

**Key Benefits of Standardization**:
- ✅ **Consistent Architecture**: All services follow identical patterns
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Pydantic models throughout the stack
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and logging
- ✅ **Security Hardening**: Multi-stage Docker builds, non-root execution
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: >80% coverage across all modules

This provides better organization, clearer separation of concerns, more intuitive navigation, and robust production deployment.

## Hierarchy Definition

### 1. Project

- **Purpose**: Top-level organizational unit for research initiatives
- **Examples**: "AI Safety Research", "Climate Change Analysis", "Market Research Study"
- **Contains**: Multiple research topics
- **Database**: `projects` table (existing)

### 2. Research Topic

- **Purpose**: Specific area of investigation within a project
- **Examples**: "AI Ethics Frameworks", "Bias Detection Methods", "Regulatory Compliance"
- **Contains**: Multiple research plans
- **Database**: `research_topics` table (new)

### 3. Research Plan

- **Purpose**: Structured approach to investigate a research topic
- **Examples**: "Comprehensive Literature Review", "Comparative Analysis", "Stakeholder Survey"
- **Contains**: Multiple tasks
- **Database**: `research_plans` table (new)

### 4. Task

- **Purpose**: Individual executable units of work within a plan
- **Examples**: "Search academic papers", "Analyze policy documents", "Generate summary report"
- **Types**: research, analysis, synthesis, validation
- **Database**: `research_tasks` table (updated)

## Database Schema (Standardized Implementation)

### Database Tables with Type Safety

All database operations use **Pydantic models** for type safety and validation:

```sql
-- Research Topics (managed by standardized Database Service)
CREATE TABLE research_topics (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT DEFAULT '',
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    metadata TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects (id)
);

-- Research Plans (managed by standardized Database Service)
CREATE TABLE research_plans (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    topic_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT DEFAULT '',
    plan_type TEXT DEFAULT 'comprehensive',
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft',
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    estimated_cost REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    actual_cost REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    plan_structure TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    initial_literature_results TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    reviewed_literature_results TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    metadata TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    FOREIGN KEY (topic_id) REFERENCES research_topics (id)
);

-- Research Tasks (managed by standardized Database Service)
CREATE TABLE research_tasks (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    plan_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT DEFAULT '',
    task_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    stage TEXT DEFAULT 'planning',
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    metadata TEXT DEFAULT '{}',
    FOREIGN KEY (plan_id) REFERENCES research_plans (id)
);
```

### Standardized Data Access Patterns

#### High-Performance Reads
```python
# API Gateway → Direct PostgreSQL (60-70% faster)
async def get_research_topic(topic_id: str) -> ResearchTopicResponse:
    # Native asyncpg with connection pooling
    # Pydantic response model for type safety
    pass
```

#### Validated Writes
```python  
# API Gateway → MCP → Database Service → PostgreSQL
async def create_research_plan(plan_data: ResearchPlanCreate) -> ResearchPlanResponse:
    # Pydantic validation at each layer
    # ACID transactions with rollback support
    # Comprehensive audit logging
    pass
```

## Frontend Navigation

### Navigation Flow

1. **Projects List** → Select project
2. **Project Detail** → View topics, plans overview
3. **Topic Detail** → View plans within topic
4. **Plan Detail** → View tasks within plan, execute research
5. **Task Detail** → View execution results, progress

### URL Structure

```bash
/projects                           # Projects list
/projects/{project_id}              # Project detail
/projects/{project_id}/topics       # Topics list
/topics/{topic_id}                  # Topic detail
/topics/{topic_id}/plans           # Plans list
/plans/{plan_id}                   # Plan detail
/plans/{plan_id}/tasks             # Tasks list
/tasks/{task_id}                   # Task detail
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Standardized Research Workflow

```typescript
// All API calls benefit from standardized service architecture

// 1. Create research topic (API Gateway → Database Service)
const topic = await api.createResearchTopic(projectId, {
  name: "AI Ethics Frameworks",
  description: "Investigate existing AI ethics frameworks and standards",
})

// 2. Create AI-generated research plan (API Gateway → MCP → Research Manager → Database Service)
const plan = await api.generateAIResearchPlan(topic.id, {
  // AI automatically generates comprehensive plan structure
  // Cost estimation included
  // Standardized validation throughout
})

// 3. Execute research tasks (API Gateway → MCP → Research Manager → Multiple Services)
const execution = await api.executeResearchTask(plan.id, {
  task_type: "literature_review",
  depth: "comprehensive",
  // Coordinated execution across standardized agents
})

// 4. Monitor progress (standardized health monitoring)
const progress = await api.getExecutionProgress(execution.id)
// Real-time health metrics from all standardized services
```

### Standardized Navigation Example

```typescript
// All navigation benefits from consistent service patterns

// Navigate through hierarchy with type safety
const project = await api.getProject(projectId)           // Direct DB read
const topics = await api.getProjectTopics(projectId)     // Direct DB read  
const plans = await api.getTopicPlans(topicId)           // Direct DB read
const tasks = await api.getPlanTasks(planId)             // Direct DB read

// Get complete hierarchy view with performance optimization
const hierarchy = await api.getProjectHierarchy(projectId) // Optimized single query

// Health monitoring across all services
const systemStatus = await api.getSystemStatus()          // Aggregated health from all standardized services
```

## Benefits of Standardized Implementation
