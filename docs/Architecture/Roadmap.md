# Eunice Research Platform Roadmap

## Overview

This is the development roadmap for the Eunice Research Platform, tracking progress through standardization and future development.

## Version 0.4.1 - Platform Standardization 🔶 **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

[🔶] **Complete Platform Standardization** (Mostly Complete)
- [✅] Standardized all 7 services and 1 agent with identical architecture patterns
- [✅] Created comprehensive template system (15+ standardized files)
- [✅] Implemented automated migration script with backup functionality
- [❌] Achieved >80% test coverage across all modules (Only basic health/config tests exist)
- [✅] Multi-stage Docker builds with security hardening
- [✅] Type-safe configuration with Pydantic models
- [✅] Comprehensive health monitoring and structured logging
- [✅] Production-ready deployment patterns

[✅] **Architecture Documentation Consolidation**
- [✅] Created comprehensive Eunice_Architecture_v0.4.1.md technical specification
- [✅] Updated main Eunice_Architecture.md with standardized overview
- [✅] Consolidated Function_Map.md with current API structure
- [✅] Updated Hierarchical_Research_Structure.md for standardized implementation

[✅] **Platform Redesign to AI Prompt Driven**
- [✅] Research Manager Agent with standardized prompt configuration
- [✅] MCP-based agent coordination with WebSocket communication  
- [✅] AI-generated research plans with cost estimation
- [✅] Standardized task execution across coordinated agents

[✅] Platform redesign to be AI prompt driven.
[✅] Implement frontend API calls for direct database read and write.
    - ✅ `create_project`, `update_project`, `delete_project`
    - ✅ `create_research_topic`, `update_research_topic`, `delete_research_topic`
    - ✅ `update_research_plan`, `delete_research_plan`, `approve_research_plan`
[🔶] Unit test all functional API calls on the API Gateway. (Only basic health/config tests exist - missing API endpoint tests)    

[✅] Authentication function for all APIs.
    - [✅] JWT access tokens (30 min) and refresh tokens (7 days)
    - [✅] TOTP-based 2FA with Google/Microsoft Authenticator support
    - [✅] Password strength validation with real-time feedback
    - [✅] Email and username-based login support
    - [✅] Backup codes for 2FA account recovery
    - [✅] RBAC System: Admin, Researcher, Collaborator roles
    - [✅] Security Implementation: bcrypt hashing, JWT signing
    - [✅] Container Security: non-root execution, resource limits
        - Resource limits and health checks

### Priority: Complete v0.4.1 Remaining Items
