      "title": "Songbird organotypic culture as an in vitro model for interrogating sparse sequencing networks",
      "abstract": "Sparse sequences of neuronal activity are fundamental features of neural circuit computation; however, the underlying homeostatic mechanisms remain poorly understood. To approach these questions, we have developed a method for cellular-resolution imaging in organotypic cultures of the adult zebra finch brain, including portions of the intact song circuit. These in vitro networks can survive for weeks, and display mature neuron morphologies. Neurons within the organotypic slices exhibit a diversity of spontaneous and pharmacologically induced activity that can be easily monitored using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6. In this study, we primarily focus on the classic song sequence generator HVC and the surrounding areas. We describe proof of concept experiments including physiological, optical, and pharmacological manipulation of these exposed networks. This method may allow the cellular rules underlying sparse, stereotyped neural sequencing to be examined with new degrees of experimental control"

      "title": "Origins of the avian neural crest: the role of neural plate-epidermal interactions",
      "abstract": "We have investigated the lineage and tissue interactions that result in avian neural crest cell formation from the ectoderm. Presumptive neural plate was grafted adjacent to non-neural ectoderm in whole embryo culture to examine the role of tissue interactions in ontogeny of the neural crest. Our results show that juxtaposition of non-neural ectoderm and presumptive neural plate induces the formation of neural crest cells. Quail/chick recombinations demonstrate that both the prospective neural plate and the prospective epidermis can contribute to the neural crest. When similar neural plate/epidermal confrontations are performed in tissue culture to look at the formation of neural crest derivatives, juxtaposition of epidermis with either early (stages 4–5) or later (stages 6–10) neural plate results in the generation of both melanocytes and sympathoadrenal cells. Interestingly, neural plates isolated from early stages form no neural crest cells, whereas those isolated later give rise to melanocytes but not crest-derived sympathoadrenal cells. Single cell lineage analysis was performed to determine the time at which the neural crest lineage diverges from the epidermal lineage and to elucidate the timing of neural plate/epidermis interactions during normal development. Our results from stage 8 to 10+ embryos show that the neural plate/neural crest lineage segregates from the epidermis around the time of neural tube closure, suggesting that neural induction is still underway at open neural plate stages"

      "title": "Nondirected axonal growth on basal lamina from avian embryonic neural retina",
      "abstract": "The vitreous surface of the embryonic avian retinal neuroepithelium was isolated by mechanical disruption of the retina mounted between 2 adhesive substrata. The 200-micron-thick sheath covered an area of up to 1 cm2 and consisted of the vitreal basal lamina with a lamina densa, 2 laminae rarae, and a carpet of ventricular cell endfeet on top of the lamina. The vitreal endfeet were removed by detergent treatment and an extracellular basal lamina was obtained. The laminae were further characterized by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. A 190 kDa laminin protein was detected in laminae with and without vitreal endfeet, whereas the membrane-bound neural cell adhesion molecule (N- CAM) was detectable only on the endfeet of the ventricular cells and was absent in the detergent-treated basal laminae. Neither immunoblotting nor immunostaining revealed fibronectin in these preparations. Explants of retina, sensory ganglia, and cerebellum from chick, quail, and mouse were cultured on the basal lamina as a substratum. In all cases axonal outgrowth was excellent, with a growth rate similar to that in situ. Outgrowing axons from sensory ganglia and cerebellar explants were accompanied by migratory cells, which, in the case of sensory ganglia, were flat cells and, in the case of cerebellar explants, resembled granular neurons. Optic axons grew on the laminae in an asymmetric, explant-inherent pattern specific for the position of origin of the explant. On detergent-treated basal laminae, as well as on laminin, the retinal axons grew in a clockwise orientation. This axonal growth pattern was specific for retinal tissue and was not observed with axons from other neural explants. In spite of the excellent substrate properties provided by the substratum, cues for growing axons (toward or away from the optic disk) were not detectable in the basal lamina preparations"

      "title": "Development and Characterization of Primary Brain Cultures from Japanese Quail Embryos.",
      "abstract": "Cell cultures play a crucial role in neuroscience research, facilitating the elucidation of the complexities of cellular physiology and pathology. The relative simplicity in producing cultures and the accessibility to cells that the cultures provide, in contrast to in vivo settings, allow users to manipulate and monitor cells more easily at higher throughputs and lower costs. These are ideal for screening purposes and electrophysiological characterizations. Despite the prevalence of methodologies for producing brain cultures from various animal models, rodents in particular, approaches for culturing neurons (and glia) from birds are less established or completely absent as in the case of the Japanese quail model. Here, we present a unique culturing protocol for brain cells (e.g., neurons at different maturation levels, such as progenitor cells, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells) from entire forebrains of Japanese quail embryos for high-throughput screening of viral vectors in vitro and other various purposes. Following dissection and digestion methods uniquely suited for avian brains, we tailored the growth media and culturing surface to allow the survival of quail brain cultures for more than three weeks in vitro. Key features • We introduce a detailed protocol for producing primary brain cultures from quail embryos' forebrains for up to 30 days. • We show that the cultures support in vitro viral transfections effectively. • We demonstrate the use of the cultures for rapid (days) screening for suitable viruses for quail brain cells, electrophysiological characterizations, and single mRNA sequencing."

      "title": "Heat stress attenuates new cell generation in the hypothalamus: a role for miR-138.",
      "abstract": "The anterior hypothalamus (Ant Hyp) of the brain serves as the main regulator of numerous homeostatic functions, among them body temperature. Fine-tuning of the thermal-response set point during the critical postnatal sensory-developmental period involves neuronal network remodeling which might also be accompanied by alterations in hypothalamic cell populations. Here we demonstrate that heat stress during the critical period of thermal-control establishment interferes with generation of new cells in the chick hypothalamus. Whereas conditioning of the 3-day-old chicks under high ambient temperatures for 24h diminished the number of newborn cells in anterior hypothalamic structures 1 week after the treatment, mild heat stress did not influence the amount of new cells. Phenotypic analysis of these newborn cells indicated a predominant decrease in non-neuronal cell precursors, i.e. cells that do not express doublecortin (DCX). Furthermore, heat challenge of 10-day-old previously high-temperature-conditioned chicks abolished hypothalamic neurogenesis and significantly decreased the number of cells of non-neural origin. As a potential regulatory mechanism for the underlying generation of new cells in the hypothalamus, we investigated the role of the microRNA (miRNA) miR-138, previously reported by us to promote hypothalamic cell migration in vitro and whose levels are reduced during heat stress. Intracranial injection into the third ventricle of miR-138 led to an increase in the number of newborn cells in the Ant Hyp, an effect which might be partially mediated by inhibition of its direct target reelin. These data demonstrate the role of ambient temperature on the generation of new cells in the hypothalamus during the critical period of thermal-control establishment and highlight the long-term effect of severe heat stress on hypothalamic cell population. Moreover, miRNAs, miR-138 in particular, can regulate new cell generation in the hypothalamus."
