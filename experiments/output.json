    "abstract": "Culture medium conditioned (CM) by embryonic chick skeletal muscle or RN22 Schwannoma cells enhanced dramatically the neuritic development of chick embryonic spinal cord slices explanted onto a collagen substratum. The addition of a mixture of bovine brain gangliosides (BBG) or the monosialoganglioside GM1 to this medium potentiated the nerve growth factor (NGF)-independent CM-mediated neuritogenesis. A 3-4 fold increase in spinal cord outgrowth was due to increased neurite number, length and branching. The ability of the gangliosides to potentiate the positive neuritogenic action of CM was not limited solely to spinal cord cultures since similar results were obtained in parallel studies employing organized cultures of embryonic chick ciliary ganglia. These studies demonstrate the ability of gangliosides to enhance the trophic action of factor(s) present in CM. They suggest further that gangliosides may play a modulatory role in the development of the nervous system.",

    "title": "The neurotrophic effects of fibroblast growth factors on dopaminergic neurons in vitro are mediated by mesencephalic glia [published erratum appears in J Neurosci 1992 Mar;12(3):685]",
    "abstract": "Neurotrophic support is generally believed to result from a direct action of growth factors on developing neurons. However, there is increasing evidence that growth factors can indirectly affect neuronal development by glial-mediated processes. To investigate a possible role of glia in mediating neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic neurons, four purified growth factors were screened for dual effects on the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and on the proliferation of mesencephalic glial cells in vitro. Dissociated embryonic day 14.5 rat mesencephalon was grown at low cell density without serum, conditions under which both glial growth and neuronal survival are not optimal. Treatment of these cultures with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased the number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons by 90- 110% [corrected] at 8 d in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of these factors were not additive. High-affinity dopamine uptake was increased by bFGF, but not by aFGF. Length of TH-IR neurites was not affected by either aFGF or bFGF. Both growth factors induced proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes as demonstrated by autoradiographic labeling with 3H-thymidine combined with immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-1 had no effect on the survival or differentiation of dopaminergic neurons or the proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes. Inhibition of glial proliferation abolished the neurotrophic effects exerted by aFGF or bFGF on dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, conditioned medium derived from mesencephalic glial cultures replated in the virtual absence of neurons also contained neurotrophic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Laminin promotes neuritic regeneration from cultured peripheral and central neurons.",
    "abstract": "The ability of axons to grow through tissue in vivo during development or regeneration may be regulated by the availability of specific neurite-promoting macromolecules located within the extracellular matrix. We have used tissue culture methods to examine the relative ability of various extracellular matrix components to elicit neurite outgrowth from dissociated chick embryo parasympathetic (ciliary ganglion) neurons in serum-free monolayer culture. Purified laminin from both mouse and rat sources, as well as a partially purified polyornithine-binding neurite promoting factor (PNPF-1) from rat Schwannoma cells all stimulate neurite production from these neurons. Laminin and PNPF-1 are also potent stimulators of neurite growth from cultured neurons obtained from other peripheral as well as central neural tissues, specifically avian sympathetic and sensory ganglia and spinal cord, optic tectum, neural retina, and telencephalon, as well as from sensory ganglia of the neonatal mouse and hippocampal, septal, and striatal tissues of the fetal rat. A quantitative in vitro bioassay method using ciliary neurons was used to (a) measure and compare the specific neurite-promoting activities of these agents, (b) confirm that during the purification of laminin, the neurite-promoting activity co-purifies with the laminin protein, and (c) compare the influences of antilaminin antibodies on the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and PNPF-1. We conclude that laminin and PNPF-1 are distinct macromolecules capable of expressing their neurite-promoting activities even when presented in nanogram amounts. This neurite-promoting bioassay currently represents the most sensitive test for the biological activity of laminin.",

    "title": "Basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors have trophic effects on neurons from multiple CNS regions",
    "abstract": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supports the survival of neurons from many regions of the E18 fetal rat brain. Survival was significantly increased for neurons derived from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), frontal cortex, parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex, striatum, septum, and thalamus, but not from the subiculum (Sb). The proportion of neurons rescued by bFGF varied among brain regions, suggesting the existence of subpopulations of responsive neurons. Like hippocampal neurons, neurons from the EC and PC required about 1 pM bFGF (10-20 pg/ml) for half-maximal response; striatal neurons, in contrast, required about 3 pM bFGF. Neurite outgrowth after 24 hr exposure was significantly increased for neurons from the hippocampus, EC, and PC, while striatal neurons had only a marginal response. Although bFGF stimulated some astrocytic proliferation in the cultures, glial contamination was maintained at 2% or less. Acidic FGF (aFGF) supported smaller numbers of neurons from each region, although it significantly increased survival of neurons from hippocampus, EC, PC, striatum, and Sb. The concentration required for half-maximal survival was around 100-300 pM (2-5 ng/ml). It appears that bFGF and aFGF are potent trophic factors for many populations of CNS neurons and could potentially play a significant role in nervous system development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was first identified and partially purified from embryonic chick eye tissues. Subsequently, it was shown that CNTF is also present in large amounts in sciatic nerves of adult rats and rabbits, which led to its final purification and cloning. CNTF is not secreted by the classical secretory pathway involving the endoplasmatic reticulum and Golgi complex, but can be detected in high quantities within the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells and astrocytes using immunohistochemistry. CNTF supports survival and / or differentiation of a variety of neuronal cell types including sensory, sympathetic and motoneurons. Also, nonneuroanl cells, such as oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, liver cells, and skeletal muscle cells, respond to exogenously administered CNTF, both in vitro and in vivo . During development, expression of CNTF is very low, if indeed it is expressed at all, and the phenotype of mice lacking endogenous CNTF, suggesting that CNTF after inactivation of the CNTF gene by homologous recombination suggests that CNTF does not play a crucial role for responsive cells during embryonic development. However, motoneurons are lost postnatally in mice lacking endogenous CNTF, suggesting that CNTF acts physiologically on the maintenance of these cells. The ability of exogenous CNTF to protect against motoneuron loss following lesion or in other animal models indicates that CNTF might be useful in the treatment of human motoneuron disorders, provided appropriate means of administration can be found. 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "title": "Functional plasticity of GAT-3 in avian M\u00fcller cells is regulated by neurons via a glutamatergic input",
    "abstract": "GABA (\u03b3-amino butyric acid) is the major inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous system and its action is terminated by specific transporters (GAT), found in neurons and glial cells. We have previously described that GAT-3 is responsible for GABA uptake activity in cultured avian M\u00fcller cells and that it operates in a Na(+) and Cl(-) dependent manner. Here we show that glutamate decreases [(3)H] GABA uptake in purified cultured glial cells up to 50%, without causing cell death. This effect is mediated by ionotropic glutamatergic receptors. Glutamate inhibition on GABA uptake is not reverted by inhibitors of protein kinase C or modified by agents that modulate cyclic AMP/PKA. Biotinylation experiments demonstrate that this reduction in GABA uptake correlates with a decrease in GAT-3 plasma membrane levels. Interestingly, both GAT-1 and GAT-3 mRNA levels are also decreased by glutamate. Conditioned media (CM) prepared from retinal neurons could also decrease GABA influx, and glutamate receptor antagonists (MK-801 + CNQX) were able to prevent this effect. However, glutamate levels in CM were not different from those found in fresh media, indicating that a glutamatergic co-agonist or modulator could be regulating GABA uptake by M\u00fcller cells in this scenario. In the whole avian retina, GAT-3 is present from embryonic day 5 (E5) increasing up to the end of embryonic development and post-hatch period exclusively in neuronal layers. However, this pattern may change in pathological conditions, which drive GAT-3 expression in M\u00fcller cells. Our data suggest that in purified cultures and upon extensive neuronal lesion in vivo, shown as a Brn3a reduced neuronal cells and an GFAP increased gliosis, M\u00fcller glia may change its capacity to take up GABA due to GAT-3 up regulation and suggests a regulatory interplay mediated by glutamate between neurons and glial cells in this process.",

    "abstract": "The adult mammalian subventricular zone (SVZ) contains stem cells that give rise to neurons and glia. In vivo , SVZ progeny migrate 3\u20138 mm to the olfactory bulb, where they form neurons. We show here that the SVZ of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles in adult mice is composed of neuroblasts, glial cells, and a novel putative precursor cell. The topographical organization of these cells suggests how neurogenesis and migration are integrated in this region. Type A cells had the ultrastructure of migrating neuronal precursors. These cells were arranged as chains parallel to the walls of the ventricle and were polysialylated neural adhesion cell molecule- (PSA\u2013NCAM), TuJ1- (\u03b2-tubulin), and nestin-positive but GFAP- and vimentin-negative. Chains of Type A cells were ensheathed by two ultrastructurally distinct astrocytes (Type B1 and B2) that were GFAP-, vimentin-, and nestin-positive but PSA\u2013NCAM- and TuJ1-negative. Type A and B2 (but not B1) cells incorporated [ 3 H]thymidine. The most actively dividing cell in the SVZ corresponded to Type C cells, which had immature ultrastructural characteristics and were nestin-positive but negative to the other markers. Type C cells formed focal clusters closely associated with chains of Type A cells. Whereas Type C cells were present throughout the SVZ, they were not found in the rostral migratory stream that links the SVZ with the olfactory bulb. These results suggest that chains of migrating neuroblasts in the SVZ may be derived from Type C cells. Our results provide a topographical model for the adult SVZ and should serve as a basis for the in vivo identification of stem cells in the adult mammalian brain.",

    "title": "Glutathione-Induced Calcium Shifts in Chick Retinal Glial Cells",
    "abstract": "Neuroglia interactions are essential for the nervous system and in the retina M\u00fcller cells interact with most of the neurons in a symbiotic manner. Glutathione (GSH) is a low-molecular weight compound that undertakes major antioxidant roles in neurons and glia, however, whether this compound could act as a signaling molecule in neurons and/or glia is currently unknown. Here we used embryonic avian retina to obtain mixed retinal cells or purified M\u00fcller glia cells in culture to evaluate calcium shifts induced by GSH. A dose response curve (0.1\u201310mM) showed that 5\u201310mM GSH, induced calcium shifts exclusively in glial cells (later labeled and identified as 2M6 positive cells), while neurons responded to 50mM KCl (labeled as \u03b2III tubulin positive cells). BBG 100nM, a P2X7 blocker, inhibited the effects of GSH on M\u00fcller glia. However, addition of DNQX 70\u03bcM and MK-801 20\u03bcM, non-NMDA and NMDA blockers, had no effect on GSH calcium induced shift. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) at 5mM failed to induce calcium mobilization in glia cells, indicating that the antioxidant and/or structural features of GSH are essential to promote elevations in cytoplasmic calcium levels. Indeed, a short GSH pulse (60s) protects M\u00fcller glia from oxidative damage after 30 min of incubation with 0.1% H2O2. Finally, GSH induced GABA release from chick embryonic retina, mixed neuron-glia or from M\u00fcller cell cultures, which were inhibited by BBG or in the absence of sodium. GSH also induced propidium iodide uptake in M\u00fcller cells in culture in a P2X7 receptor dependent manner. Our data suggest that GSH, in addition to antioxidant effects, could act signaling calcium shifts at the millimolar range particularly in M\u00fcller glia, and could regulate the release of GABA, with additional protective effects on retinal neuron-glial circuit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The time course of production and release of nerve growth factor (NGF) and non\u2010NGF neuronotrophic factors for sympathetic neurons by chicken and rat sciatic nerves in culture was examined. These tissues actively synthesize and release neuronotrophic activity as metabolically poisoning nerves with azide dramatically reduced the amount of trophic activity released into the culture medium. The sustained release of this activity also was shown to be dependent on the presence of low\u2010molecular\u2010weight dialysable molecules present in foetal calf serum and amniotic fluid from day 11 chicken embryos. Affinity\u2010purified antimouse NGF antibodies were used to show that sciatic nerves in culture release both NGF and non\u2010NGF trophic factors. These antibodies inhibited all bioactivity of both mouse NGF and of a partially purified preparation of chicken NGF. Immunoblot studies confirm that the antibodies recognize both rodent and avian NGF. Excess antibody inhibited only about 50% of the trophic activity in media conditioned over rat or chicken nerves for the first 24 hr. Relatively similar amounts of this non\u2010NGF trophic activity were released throughout 6 days in culture, and this trophic activity kept sympathetic neurons alive in culture in the absence of NGF for more than 4 days. NGF levels were quantified with a two\u2010site enzyme\u2010linked immunoassay and found to parallel changes in NGF bioactivity. Rat nerves released increasing amounts of NGF with time in culture. Whole chicken sciatic nerves, however, released decreasing amounts of NGF with time in culture, but when these nerves were desheathed by removal of the epineurium and attached tissue, the pattern of NGF release was similar to that observed in the smaller rat sciatic nerves. These studies therefore characterize antibodies recognising chicken NGF, demonstrate that peripheral nerve tissue synthesize trophic factors other than NGF, and identify factors that influence NGF synthesis.",

Cell to cell communication is crucial for any multicellular organism. A major portion of these communication events relies on secreted proteins that act on neighboring cells as well as on target cells far from the source cell. This has a particular bearing for nerve cells because neuronal survival depends on neurotrophic factors released from surrounding tissues, and in the absence of such factors the neurons undergo programmed cell death (1Davies A.M. The role of neurotrophins in the developing nervous system.J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Hereditary degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells is a major cause of blindness and often the result of mutations in phototransduction-relevant genes (2Herse P. Retinitis pigmentosa: visual function and multidisciplinary management.Clin. Exp. Optom. 2005; 88: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguingly although the mutations are present from beginning, the degeneration often does not occur until late in life. One explanation for such a delayed photoreceptor apoptosis may be the existence of paracrine, neurotrophic activities produced by the highly reactive support cells of the retina, the retinal Mueller glial cells (RMGs). 1The abbreviations used are: RMG, retinal Mueller glial cell; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional; CM, conditioned medium; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; PR, photoreceptor; RMG-CM, retinal Mueller glial cell-derived conditioned medium; SODC, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase; THIO, thioredoxin; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: RMG, retinal Mueller glial cell; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional; CM, conditioned medium; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; PR, photoreceptor; RMG-CM, retinal Mueller glial cell-derived conditioned medium; SODC, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase; THIO, thioredoxin; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor. Factors of this kind could be capable of upholding photoreceptor function for long periods even in diseased gene background, although finally the demand for support may exceed the supply upon which the balance shifts to cell death. As such, strategies to support degenerating photoreceptors via exogenously given recombinant neurotrophic factors are considered as a future treatment option to halt retinal degeneration and thereby preventing blindness. There are several reports suggesting the existence of neurotrophic molecules",

One such supplement is a protein termed the ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) which is present at very high concentrations within intraocular tissues that contain the same muscle cells innervated by ciliary ganglionic neurons in vivo. We describe here the purification of chick eye CNTF by a 2\u00bd\u2010day procedure involving the processing of intraocular tissue extract sequentially through DE52 ion\u2010exchange chromatography, membrane ultrafiltration\u2010concentration, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gradient electrophoresis. An aqueous extract of the tissue from 300 eyes will yield about 10\u201320 \u03bcg of biologically active, electrophoretically pure CNTF with a specific activity of 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 trophic units/mg protein. Purified CNTF has an M r of 20,400 daltons and an isoelectric point of about 5, as determined by analytical gel electrophoresis. In addition to supporting the survival of ciliary ganglion neurons, purified CNTF also supports the 24\u2010h survival of cultured neurons from certain chick and rodent sensory and sympathetic ganglia. CNTF differs from mouse submaxillary nerve growth factor (NGF) in molecular weight, isoelectric point, inability to be inactivated by antibodies to NGF, ability to support the in vitro survival of the ciliary ganglion neurons, and inability to support that of 8\u2010day chick embryo dorsal root ganglionic neurons.

    "abstract": "Detection and characterization of chemically-induced toxic effects in the nervous system represent a challenge for the hazard assessment of chemicals. In vivo, neurotoxicological assessments exploit the fact that the activity of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system has functional consequences. And so far, no in vitro method for evaluating the neurotoxic hazard has yet been validated and accepted for regulatory purpose. The microelectrode array (MEA) assay consists of a culture chamber into which an integrated array of microelectrodes is capable of measuring extracellular electrophysiology (spikes and bursts) from electro-active tissues. A wide variety of electrically excitable biological tissues may be placed onto the chips including primary cultures of nervous system tissue. Recordings from this type of in vitro cultured system are non invasive, give label free evaluations and provide a higher throughput than conventional electrophysiological techniques. In this paper, twenty substances were tested in a blinded study for their toxicity and dose-response curves were obtained from foetal rat cortical neuronal networks coupled to MEAs. The experimental procedure consisted of evaluating the firing activity (spiking rate) and modification/reduction in response to chemical administration. Native/reference activity, 30 minutes of activity recording per dilution, plus the recovery points (after 24 hours) were recorded. The preliminary data, using a set of chemicals with different mode-of-actions (13 known to be neurotoxic, 2 non-neuroactive and not toxic and 5 non-neuroactive but toxic) show good predictivity (sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.86; accuracy: 0.85). Thus, the MEA with a neuronal network has the potency to become an effective tool to evaluate the neurotoxicity of substances in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The limited access to functional human brain tissue has led to the development of stem cell-based alternative models. The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cerebral organoids with self-organized architecture has created novel opportunities to study the early stages of the human cerebral formation. Here we applied state-of-the-art label-free shotgun proteomics to compare the proteome of stem cell-derived cerebral organoids to the human fetal brain. We identified 3,073 proteins associated with different developmental stages, from neural progenitors to neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. The major protein groups are associated with neurogenesis, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and cortical brain development. Glial cell proteins related to cell growth and maintenance, energy metabolism, cell communication, and signaling were also described. Our data support the variety of cells and neural network functional pathways observed within cell-derived cerebral organoids, confirming their usefulness as an alternative model. The characterization of brain organoid proteome is key to explore, in a dish, atypical and disrupted processes during brain development or neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "title": "A metabolic switch in brain: glucose and lactate metabolism modulation by ascorbic acid",
    "abstract": "Abstract In this review, we discuss a novel function of ascorbic acid in brain energetics. It has been proposed that during glutamatergic synaptic activity neurons preferably consume lactate released from glia. The key to this energetic coupling is the metabolic activation that occurs in astrocytes by glutamate and an increase in extracellular [K + ]. Neurons are cells well equipped to consume glucose because they express glucose transporters and glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Moreover, neuronal cells express monocarboxylate transporters and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1, which is inhibited by pyruvate. As glycolysis produces an increase in pyruvate concentration and a decrease in NAD + /NADH, lactate and glucose consumption are not viable at the same time. In this context, we discuss ascorbic acid participation as a metabolic switch modulating neuronal metabolism between rest and activation periods. Ascorbic acid is highly concentrated in CNS. Glutamate stimulates ascorbic acid release from astrocytes. Ascorbic acid entry into neurons and within the cell can inhibit glucose consumption and stimulate lactate transport. For this switch to occur, an ascorbic acid flow is necessary between astrocytes and neurons, which is driven by neural activity and is part of vitamin C recycling. Here, we review the role of glucose and lactate as metabolic substrates and the modulation of neuronal metabolism by ascorbic acid.",

    "title": "Pyruvate participation in the low molecular weight trophic activity for central nervous system neurons in glia-conditioned media",
    "abstract": "Conditioned media from glial cell cultures contain low molecular weight agents which can support survival of CNS neurons in the absence of recognized protein neuronotrophic factors. A similar support is provided to CNS neurons by selected basal media, and pyruvate is the critical medium constituent responsible for their trophic competence. Eagle's basal medium, which contains no pyruvate, acquires pyruvate when conditioned over astroglial cell cultures. Enzymatic degradation of the pyruvate in the astroglia-conditioned medium leads to corresponding losses in its low molecular weight trophic activity for CNS neurons. Quantitative correlations between pyruvate content and CNS trophic activity demonstrate that pyruvate is the main trophic ingredient of the glia-conditioned medium, and other low molecular weight substances, acquired during conditioning, reduce the pyruvate concentration required for its trophic effect. The \"pyruvate-sparing\" substances, as yet unidentified, are not the serine and Fe3+ which have pyruvate-sparing competence for peripheral, ciliary ganglionic neurons. These findings, together with previous observations, propose that prenatal neurons fail to generate or retain endogenous pyruvate at the levels for their survival-sustaining activities.",
