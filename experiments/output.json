    "title": "Mesodermal cell types induce neurogenesis from adult human hippocampal progenitor cells",
    "abstract": "Abstract Neurogenesis in the adult human brain occurs within two principle neurogenic regions, the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Recent reports demonstrated the isolation of human neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) from these regions, but due to limited tissue availability the knowledge of their phenotype and differentiation behavior is restricted. Here we characterize the phenotype and differentiation capacity of human adult hippocampal NPCs (hNPCs), derived from patients who underwent epilepsy surgery, on various feeder cells including fetal mixed cortical cultures, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and PA6 stromal cells. Isolated hNPCs were cultured in clonal density by transferring the cells to serum\u2010free media supplemented with FGF\u20102 and EGF in 3% atmospheric oxygen. These hNPCs showed neurosphere formation, expressed high levels of early neuroectodermal markers, such as the proneural genes NeuroD1 and Olig2 , the NSC markers Nestin and Musashi1, the proliferation marker Ki67 and significant activity of telomerase. The phenotype was CD15 low/\u2013 , CD34 \u2013 , CD45 \u2013 and CD133 \u2013 . After removal of mitogens and plating them on poly d \u2010lysine, they spontaneously differentiated into a neuronal (MAP2ab + ), astroglial (GFAP + ), and oligodendroglial (GalC + ) phenotype. Differentiated hNPCs showed functional properties of neurons, such as sodium channels, action potentials and production of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Co\u2010culture of hNPCs with fetal cortical cultures, MEFs and PA6 cells increased neurogenesis of hNPCs in vitro , while only MEFs and PA6 cells also led to a morphological and functional neurogenic maturation. Together we provide a first detailed characterization of the phenotype and differentiation potential of human adult hNPCs in vitro . Our findings reinforce the emerging view that the differentiation capacity of adult hNPCs is critically influenced by non\u2010neuronal mesodermal feeder cells.",

    "abstract": "Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) have both been shown to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration following injury and target different neuronal populations. The delivery of either growth factor at the site of injury may, therefore, result in quantitative differences in motor nerve regeneration and functional recovery. In this study we evaluated the effect of affinity-based delivery of GDNF or NGF from fibrin-filled nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) on motor nerve regeneration and functional recovery in a 13 mm rat sciatic nerve defect. Seven experimental groups were evaluated consisting of GDNF or NGF and the affinity-based delivery system (DS) within NGCs, control groups excluding the DS and/or growth factor, and nerve isografts. Groups with growth factor in the conduit demonstrated equivalent or superior performance in behavioral tests and relative muscle mass measurements compared to isografts at 12 weeks. Additionally, groups with GDNF demonstrated greater specific twitch and tetanic force production in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle than the isograft control, while groups with NGF produced demonstrated similar force production compared to the isograft control. Assessment of motor axon regeneration by retrograde labeling further revealed that the number of ventral horn neurons regenerating across NGCs containing GDNF and NGF DS was similar to the isograft group and these counts were greater than the groups without growth factor. Overall, the GDNF DS group demonstrated superior functional recovery and equivalent motor nerve regeneration compared to the isograft control, suggesting it has potential as a treatment for motor nerve injury.",

    "title": "Basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors have trophic effects on neurons from multiple CNS regions",
    "abstract": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supports the survival of neurons from many regions of the E18 fetal rat brain. Survival was significantly increased for neurons derived from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), frontal cortex, parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex, striatum, septum, and thalamus, but not from the subiculum (Sb). The proportion of neurons rescued by bFGF varied among brain regions, suggesting the existence of subpopulations of responsive neurons. Like hippocampal neurons, neurons from the EC and PC required about 1 pM bFGF (10-20 pg/ml) for half-maximal response; striatal neurons, in contrast, required about 3 pM bFGF. Neurite outgrowth after 24 hr exposure was significantly increased for neurons from the hippocampus, EC, and PC, while striatal neurons had only a marginal response. Although bFGF stimulated some astrocytic proliferation in the cultures, glial contamination was maintained at 2% or less. Acidic FGF (aFGF) supported smaller numbers of neurons from each region, although it significantly increased survival of neurons from hippocampus, EC, PC, striatum, and Sb. The concentration required for half-maximal survival was around 100-300 pM (2-5 ng/ml). It appears that bFGF and aFGF are potent trophic factors for many populations of CNS neurons and could potentially play a significant role in nervous system development.",

    "title": "The neurotrophic effects of fibroblast growth factors on dopaminergic neurons in vitro are mediated by mesencephalic glia [published erratum appears in J Neurosci 1992 Mar;12(3):685]",
    "abstract": "Neurotrophic support is generally believed to result from a direct action of growth factors on developing neurons. However, there is increasing evidence that growth factors can indirectly affect neuronal development by glial-mediated processes. To investigate a possible role of glia in mediating neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic neurons, four purified growth factors were screened for dual effects on the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and on the proliferation of mesencephalic glial cells in vitro. Dissociated embryonic day 14.5 rat mesencephalon was grown at low cell density without serum, conditions under which both glial growth and neuronal survival are not optimal. Treatment of these cultures with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased the number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons by 90- 110% [corrected] at 8 d in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of these factors were not additive. High-affinity dopamine uptake was increased by bFGF, but not by aFGF. Length of TH-IR neurites was not affected by either aFGF or bFGF. Both growth factors induced proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes as demonstrated by autoradiographic labeling with 3H-thymidine combined with immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-1 had no effect on the survival or differentiation of dopaminergic neurons or the proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes. Inhibition of glial proliferation abolished the neurotrophic effects exerted by aFGF or bFGF on dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, conditioned medium derived from mesencephalic glial cultures replated in the virtual absence of neurons also contained neurotrophic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "It has traditionally been held that the adult brain is incapable of significant self-repair, due in part to its inability to generate new neurons. Nevertheless, rodents and birds have been found to harbor neural precursor cells in adulthood. We asked whether the adult human brain might retain such precursors, by culturing samples of temporal lobe under conditions permissive for neuronal differentiation, while exposed to 3H-thy-midine. Adult human temporal lobe cultures, derived from cortex, subcortex, and periventricular subependymal zone (SZ), were incubated for 7\u201328 d, stained for neuronal and glial antigens, and autoradiographed. Neuron-like cells were found in explant outgrowths and monolayer dissociates of SZ and periventricular white matter, but not cortex; they expressed neuronal antigens including MAP-2, MAP-5, NF, and N-CAM, and were GFAP-. Neurons responded to K+ depolarization with rapid and reversible increases in intracellular Ca2+, with much greater increments than those noted in glia. Although most neurons were not 3H-thymidine labeled, a small number of MAP-2+ and MAP-5+/GFAP\u2212 cells did incorporate 3H-thymidine, suggesting neuronal production from precursor mitosis. Rare 3H-thymidine+ neurons were also found in cultures of subventricular white matter; in these, GFAP+ astrocytic mitogenesis was common, while O4+ oligodendrocytes, although the predominant cell type, were largely postmitotic. Thus, the adult human forebrain harbors precursor cells that retain the potential for neuronal production and differentiation in vitro.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal gradient of oligodendrocyte differentiation in chick optic tectum requires brain integrity and cell\u2010cell interactions",
    "abstract": "Abstract The development of oligodendrocytes in the chicken optic tectum (OT) was studied in vivo and in vitro by analyzing expression of myelin\u2010associated glycoprotein (MAG) with a monoclonal antibody. MAG + cells first appeared in the anterior OT on embryonic day (E) 12, were present throughout the anterior half on E15, and eventually filled the tectum on E17. This spatiotemporal appearance of MAG + oligodendrocytes resembled two streams of cells entering the OT along the afferent and efferent axonal layers. However, experiments determined that this appearance of MAG immunoreactivity was the result of a gradient of oligodendrocyte differentiation and was not cell migration. First, retroviral vector labeling of OT progenitors in vivo on E3 resulted in labeled oligodendrocytes in late embryos. In addition, pieces of OT from as early as E3 kept in culture for a week developed numerous MAG + oligodendrocytes. Pieces of both anterior and posterior E7 OT developed MAG + oligodendrocytes after 3 days in culture, well ahead of their normal schedule in vivo. BrdU incorporation studies revealed that these cells were not born in culture, but merely differentiated. Monolayer cultures made from dissociated E10 or later OT cells developed MAG + oligodendrocytes, but monolayers made from E7 OT cells did not. These experiments demonstrate that oligodendrocyte progenitors were present in the OT as early as E3, that they could differentiate precociously, and that their normal progressive differentiation in situ must be due to removal of inhibitory constraints rather than the onset of inductive factors. Also, certain cell\u2010cell interactions occur between E7 and E10, which cannot be disrupted if oligodendrocyte differentiation is to occur.

    "title": "Epidermal Growth Factor and Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 Have Different Effects on Neural Progenitors in the Adult Rat Brain",
    "abstract": "Neurons and glia are generated throughout adulthood from proliferating cells in two regions of the rat brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus. This study shows that exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have differential and site-specific effects on progenitor cells in vivo. Both growth factors expanded the SVZ progenitor population after 2 weeks of intracerebroventricular administration, but only FGF-2 induced an increase in the number of newborn cells, most prominently neurons, in the olfactory bulb, the normal destination for neuronal progenitors migrating from the SVZ. EGF, on the other hand, reduced the total number of newborn neurons reaching the olfactory bulb and substantially enhanced the generation of astrocytes in the olfactory bulb. Moreover, EGF increased the number of newborn cells in the striatum either by migration of SVZ cells or by stimulation of local progenitor cells. No evidence of neuronal differentiation of newborn striatal cells was found by three-dimensional confocal analysis, although many of these newborn cells were associated closely with striatal neurons. The proliferation of hippocampal progenitors was not affected by either growth factor. However, EGF increased the number of newborn glia and reduced the number of newborn neurons, similar to the effects seen in the olfactory bulb. These findings may be useful for elucidating the in vivo role of growth factors in neurogenesis in the adult CNS and may aid development of neuronal replacement strategies after brain damage.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells support neuronal survival and function by secreting neurotrophic cytokines. Retinal Mueller glial cells (RMGs) support retinal neurons, especially photoreceptors. These highly light-sensitive sensory neurons receive vision, and their death results in blinding diseases. It has been proposed that RMGs release factors that support photoreceptor survival, but the nature of these factors remains to be elucidated.

Cell to cell communication is crucial for any multicellular organism. A major portion of these communication events relies on secreted proteins that act on neighboring cells as well as on target cells far from the source cell. This has a particular bearing for nerve cells because neuronal survival depends on neurotrophic factors released from surrounding tissues, and in the absence of such factors the neurons undergo programmed cell death (1Davies A.M. The role of neurotrophins in the developing nervous system.J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Hereditary degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells is a major cause of blindness and often the result of mutations in phototransduction-relevant genes (2Herse P. Retinitis pigmentosa: visual function and multidisciplinary management.Clin. Exp. Optom. 2005; 88: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intriguingly although the mutations are present from beginning, the degeneration often does not occur until late in life. One explanation for such a delayed photoreceptor apoptosis may be the existence of paracrine, neurotrophic activities produced by the highly reactive support cells of the retina, the retinal Mueller glial cells (RMGs). 1The abbreviations used are: RMG, retinal Mueller glial cell; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional; CM, conditioned medium; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; PR, photoreceptor; RMG-CM, retinal Mueller glial cell-derived conditioned medium; SODC, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase; THIO, thioredoxin; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: RMG, retinal Mueller glial cell; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional; CM, conditioned medium; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; PR, photoreceptor; RMG-CM, retinal Mueller glial cell-derived conditioned medium; SODC, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase; THIO, thioredoxin; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor. Factors of this kind could be capable of upholding photoreceptor function for long periods even in diseased gene background, although finally the demand for support may exceed the supply upon which the balance shifts to cell death. As such, strategies to support degenerating photoreceptors via exogenously given recombinant neurotrophic factors are considered as a future treatment option to halt retinal degeneration and thereby preventing blindness. There are several reports suggesting the existence of neurotrophic molecules",

    "title": "Glutathione-Induced Calcium Shifts in Chick Retinal Glial Cells",
    "abstract": "Neuroglia interactions are essential for the nervous system and in the retina M\u00fcller cells interact with most of the neurons in a symbiotic manner. Glutathione (GSH) is a low-molecular weight compound that undertakes major antioxidant roles in neurons and glia, however, whether this compound could act as a signaling molecule in neurons and/or glia is currently unknown. Here we used embryonic avian retina to obtain mixed retinal cells or purified M\u00fcller glia cells in culture to evaluate calcium shifts induced by GSH. A dose response curve (0.1\u201310mM) showed that 5\u201310mM GSH, induced calcium shifts exclusively in glial cells (later labeled and identified as 2M6 positive cells), while neurons responded to 50mM KCl (labeled as \u03b2III tubulin positive cells). BBG 100nM, a P2X7 blocker, inhibited the effects of GSH on M\u00fcller glia. However, addition of DNQX 70\u03bcM and MK-801 20\u03bcM, non-NMDA and NMDA blockers, had no effect on GSH calcium induced shift. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) at 5mM failed to induce calcium mobilization in glia cells, indicating that the antioxidant and/or structural features of GSH are essential to promote elevations in cytoplasmic calcium levels. Indeed, a short GSH pulse (60s) protects M\u00fcller glia from oxidative damage after 30 min of incubation with 0.1% H2O2. Finally, GSH induced GABA release from chick embryonic retina, mixed neuron-glia or from M\u00fcller cell cultures, which were inhibited by BBG or in the absence of sodium. GSH also induced propidium iodide uptake in M\u00fcller cells in culture in a P2X7 receptor dependent manner. Our data suggest that GSH, in addition to antioxidant effects, could act signaling calcium shifts at the millimolar range particularly in M\u00fcller glia, and could regulate the release of GABA, with additional protective effects on retinal neuron-glial circuit.",

    "abstract": "We examined the behavioral and morphological correlates of the response to a single intrastriatal dispersed cell graft of fetal rat ventral mesencephalic tissue in male Fischer-344 rats of varying age (4, 17, and 24\u201326 months old) and history of mesostriatal dopamine (DA) depletion (1 or 14 months). Our goal was to determine the impact of advancing age and duration of DA depletion in the host on DA graft viability and function. The findings can be summarized as follows. (1) Fetal DA neuron grafts that were effective in completely ameliorating amphetamine-induced rotational behavior in young rats with short-term lesions were virtually without effect in aged rats with long-term lesions. Middle-aged rats with long-term lesions responded to these grafts with partial behavioral recovery. (2) Age of the host at the time of transplantation, and not duration of DA depletion, was the primary determinant of response to DA grafts. (3) Diminished efficacy of grafts in lesioned aging rats was related to decreased survival and neurite extension of transplanted DA neurons. (4) Co-grafts of DA neurons with Schwann cells as a source of neurotrophic support improved the behavioral outcome of grafts in aged lesioned rats. These findings support the view that the DA-depleted striatum of aged rats is an impoverished environment for survival, growth, and function of DA grafts. Consistent with this view, local supplementation of the neurotrophic environment of grafted DA neurons with products of co-grafted Schwann cells, a demonstrated source of neurotrophic activity for embryonic DA neurons, improved graft outcome.",

A 3-4 fold increase in spinal cord outgrowth was due to increased neurite number, length and branching. The ability of the gangliosides to potentiate the positive neuritogenic action of CM was not limited solely to spinal cord cultures since similar results were obtained in parallel studies employing organized cultures of embryonic chick ciliary ganglia. These studies demonstrate the ability of gangliosides to enhance the trophic action of factor(s) present in CM. They suggest further that gangliosides may play a modulatory role in the development of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The time course of production and release of nerve growth factor (NGF) and non\u2010NGF neuronotrophic factors for sympathetic neurons by chicken and rat sciatic nerves in culture was examined. These tissues actively synthesize and release neuronotrophic activity as metabolically poisoning nerves with azide dramatically reduced the amount of trophic activity released into the culture medium. The sustained release of this activity also was shown to be dependent on the presence of low\u2010molecular\u2010weight dialysable molecules present in foetal calf serum and amniotic fluid from day 11 chicken embryos. Affinity\u2010purified antimouse NGF antibodies were used to show that sciatic nerves in culture release both NGF and non\u2010NGF trophic factors. These antibodies inhibited all bioactivity of both mouse NGF and of a partially purified preparation of chicken NGF. Immunoblot studies confirm that the antibodies recognize both rodent and avian NGF. Excess antibody inhibited only about 50% of the trophic activity in media conditioned over rat or chicken nerves for the first 24 hr. Relatively similar amounts of this non\u2010NGF trophic activity were released throughout 6 days in culture, and this trophic activity kept sympathetic neurons alive in culture in the absence of NGF for more than 4 days. NGF levels were quantified with a two\u2010site enzyme\u2010linked immunoassay and found to parallel changes in NGF bioactivity. Rat nerves released increasing amounts of NGF with time in culture. Whole chicken sciatic nerves, however, released decreasing amounts of NGF with time in culture, but when these nerves were desheathed by removal of the epineurium and attached tissue, the pattern of NGF release was similar to that observed in the smaller rat sciatic nerves. These studies therefore characterize antibodies recognising chicken NGF, demonstrate that peripheral nerve tissue synthesize trophic factors other than NGF, and identify factors that influence NGF synthesis.",

    "title": "Adult Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells Differentiate Toward Functionally Active Neurons Under Appropriate Environmental Cues",
    "abstract": "Abstract Human adult dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) reside within the perivascular niche of dental pulp and are thought to originate from migrating cranial neural crest (CNC) cells. During embryonic development, CNC cells differentiate into a wide variety of cell types, including neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Previously, we have demonstrated that DPSCs derived from adult human third molar teeth differentiate into cell types reminiscent of CNC embryonic ontology. We hypothesized that DPSCs exposed to the appropriate environmental cues would differentiate into functionally active neurons. The data demonstrated that ex vivo-expanded human adult DPSCs responded to neuronal inductive conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Human adult DPSCs, but not human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), acquired a neuronal morphology, and expressed neuronal-specific markers at both the gene and protein levels. Culture-expanded DPSCs also exhibited the capacity to produce a sodium current consistent with functional neuronal cells when exposed to neuronal inductive media. Furthermore, the response of human DPSCs and HFFs to endogenous neuronal environmental cues was determined in vivo using an avian xenotransplantation assay. DPSCs expressed neuronal markers and acquired a neuronal morphology following transplantation into the mesencephalon of embryonic day-2 chicken embryo, whereas HFFs maintained a thin spindle fibroblastic morphology. We propose that adult human DPSCs provide a readily accessible source of exogenous stem/precursor cells that have the potential for use in cell-therapeutic paradigms to treat neurological disease. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",

    "title": "Ciliary neurotrophic factor",
    "abstract": "Abstract Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was first identified and partially purified from embryonic chick eye tissues. Subsequently, it was shown that CNTF is also present in large amounts in sciatic nerves of adult rats and rabbits, which led to its final purification and cloning. CNTF is not secreted by the classical secretory pathway involving the endoplasmatic reticulum and Golgi complex, but can be detected in high quantities within the cytoplasm of myelinating Schwann cells and astrocytes using immunohistochemistry. CNTF supports survival and / or differentiation of a variety of neuronal cell types including sensory, sympathetic and motoneurons. Also, nonneuroanl cells, such as oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, liver cells, and skeletal muscle cells, respond to exogenously administered CNTF, both in vitro and in vivo . During development, expression of CNTF is very low, if indeed it is expressed at all, and the phenotype of mice lacking endogenous CNTF, suggesting that CNTF after inactivation of the CNTF gene by homologous recombination suggests that CNTF does not play a crucial role for responsive cells during embryonic development. However, motoneurons are lost postnatally in mice lacking endogenous CNTF, suggesting that CNTF acts physiologically on the maintenance of these cells. The ability of exogenous CNTF to protect against motoneuron loss following lesion or in other animal models indicates that CNTF might be useful in the treatment of human motoneuron disorders, provided appropriate means of administration can be found. 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow stromal cells exhibit multiple traits of a stem cell population. They can be greatly expanded in vitro and induced to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal cell types. However, differentiation to non-mesenchymal fates has not been demonstrated. Here, adult rat stromal cells were expanded as undifferentiated cells in culture for more than 20 passages, indicating their proliferative capacity. A simple treatment protocol induced the stromal cells to exhibit a neuronal phenotype, expressing neuron-specific enolase, NeuN, neurofilament-M, and tau. With an optimal differentiation protocol, almost 80% of the cells expressed NSE and NF-M. The refractile cell bodies extended long processes terminating in typical growth cones and filopodia. The differentiating cells expressed nestin, characteristic of neuronal precursor stem cells, at 5 hr, but the trait was undetectable at 6 days. In contrast, expression of trkA, the nerve growth factor receptor, persisted from 5 hr through 6 days. Clonal cell lines, established from single cells, proliferated, yielding both undifferentiated and neuronal cells. Human marrow stromal cells subjected to this protocol also differentiated into neurons. Consequently, adult marrow stromal cells can be induced to overcome their mesenchymal commitment and may constitute an abundant and accessible cellular reservoir for the treatment of a variety of neurologic diseases.

    "title": "Laminin promotes neuritic regeneration from cultured peripheral and central neurons.",
    "abstract": "The ability of axons to grow through tissue in vivo during development or regeneration may be regulated by the availability of specific neurite-promoting macromolecules located within the extracellular matrix. We have used tissue culture methods to examine the relative ability of various extracellular matrix components to elicit neurite outgrowth from dissociated chick embryo parasympathetic (ciliary ganglion) neurons in serum-free monolayer culture. Purified laminin from both mouse and rat sources, as well as a partially purified polyornithine-binding neurite promoting factor (PNPF-1) from rat Schwannoma cells all stimulate neurite production from these neurons. Laminin and PNPF-1 are also potent stimulators of neurite growth from cultured neurons obtained from other peripheral as well as central neural tissues, specifically avian sympathetic and sensory ganglia and spinal cord, optic tectum, neural retina, and telencephalon, as well as from sensory ganglia of the neonatal mouse and hippocampal, septal, and striatal tissues of the fetal rat. A quantitative in vitro bioassay method using ciliary neurons was used to (a) measure and compare the specific neurite-promoting activities of these agents, (b) confirm that during the purification of laminin, the neurite-promoting activity co-purifies with the laminin protein, and (c) compare the influences of antilaminin antibodies on the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and PNPF-1. We conclude that laminin and PNPF-1 are distinct macromolecules capable of expressing their neurite-promoting activities even when presented in nanogram amounts. This neurite-promoting bioassay currently represents the most sensitive test for the biological activity of laminin.",

    "title": "Feasibility Assessment of Micro-Electrode Chip Assay as a Method of Detecting Neurotoxicity in vitro",
    "abstract": "Detection and characterization of chemically-induced toxic effects in the nervous system represent a challenge for the hazard assessment of chemicals. In vivo, neurotoxicological assessments exploit the fact that the activity of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system has functional consequences. And so far, no in vitro method for evaluating the neurotoxic hazard has yet been validated and accepted for regulatory purpose. The microelectrode array (MEA) assay consists of a culture chamber into which an integrated array of microelectrodes is capable of measuring extracellular electrophysiology (spikes and bursts) from electro-active tissues. A wide variety of electrically excitable biological tissues may be placed onto the chips including primary cultures of nervous system tissue. Recordings from this type of in vitro cultured system are non invasive, give label free evaluations and provide a higher throughput than conventional electrophysiological techniques. In this paper, twenty substances were tested in a blinded study for their toxicity and dose-response curves were obtained from foetal rat cortical neuronal networks coupled to MEAs. The experimental procedure consisted of evaluating the firing activity (spiking rate) and modification/reduction in response to chemical administration. Native/reference activity, 30 minutes of activity recording per dilution, plus the recovery points (after 24 hours) were recorded. The preliminary data, using a set of chemicals with different mode-of-actions (13 known to be neurotoxic, 2 non-neuroactive and not toxic and 5 non-neuroactive but toxic) show good predictivity (sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.86; accuracy: 0.85). Thus, the MEA with a neuronal network has the potency to become an effective tool to evaluate the neurotoxicity of substances in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Conditioned media from glial cell cultures contain low molecular weight agents which can support survival of CNS neurons in the absence of recognized protein neuronotrophic factors. A similar support is provided to CNS neurons by selected basal media, and pyruvate is the critical medium constituent responsible for their trophic competence. Eagle's basal medium, which contains no pyruvate, acquires pyruvate when conditioned over astroglial cell cultures. Enzymatic degradation of the pyruvate in the astroglia-conditioned medium leads to corresponding losses in its low molecular weight trophic activity for CNS neurons. Quantitative correlations between pyruvate content and CNS trophic activity demonstrate that pyruvate is the main trophic ingredient of the glia-conditioned medium, and other low molecular weight substances, acquired during conditioning, reduce the pyruvate concentration required for its trophic effect. The \"pyruvate-sparing\" substances, as yet unidentified, are not the serine and Fe3+ which have pyruvate-sparing competence for peripheral, ciliary ganglionic neurons. These findings, together with previous observations, propose that prenatal neurons fail to generate or retain endogenous pyruvate at the levels for their survival-sustaining activities.",

    "title": "Separation of cell types from embryonic chicken and rat spinal cord: characterization of motoneuron-enriched fractions",
    "abstract": "Single cell suspensions prepared from embryonic chick or rat spinal cords were separated into morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulation based on their buoyant densities The lightest fraction (F- 1) was highly enriched for cells containing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (CAT), a marker for developing motoneurons. The morphology biochemistry, and in vitro development of this and other spinal cord cell fractions isolated by the outlined procedure were investigated. Spinal cords, dissected from 6-day chick or 12-day rat embryos, were dissociated with trypsin and applied to iso-osmotic metrizamide density gradients. After brief centrifugation, biochemical analysis revealed that cholinergic cells migrated to lower densities than other spinal cord cells. The use of discontinuous density gradients allowed rapid and simple isolation of three fractions of viable cells (designated F-1 to F-3, lowest to highest density). Characterization of chicken and rat embryo cell fractions gave similar results. The cells in Fraction 1 were large with prominent nuclei and nucleoli, while those in F-2 and F-3 were distinctly smaller. Fraction 1 was highly enriched for cholinergic cells. The CAT specific activity (CAT/cell) was increased 400% in Fraction 1 compared to unfractionated cells, while CAT specific activity in F-2 and F-3 was reduced to 25% and less than 4% that of unfractionated cells, respectively. The recovery of cholinergic cells using this procedure was much better than with other published procedures; greater than half the spinal cord CAT activity was routinely recovered in the enriched fraction. The cholinergic-enriched cells (F-1) were unique in their in vitro growth characteristics. All fractions had neuronal cells, while non-neuronal cells were distributed primarily in F-3, fewer in F-2, and were essentially absent from F-1. Neurons in F-2 and F-3 remained viable under a variety of conditions, most of which were not supportive of F-1 cell survival. The cholinergic-enriched F-1 cells survived and developed only in the presence of muscle cells or in muscle-conditioned medium on highly adhesive substrata. Large, multipolar neurons predominated under these conditions. The method described provides a means of characterizing the factors involved in the development of distinct populations of cells from the embryonic spinal cord.",

Cells were labeled in culture with Fast Blue and were identified unequivocally by hybridization with nick\u2010translated human DNA. Intensely Fast Blue positive human leptomeningeal cells were concentrated in the implant pocket and adjacent rat leptomeninges at one and two weeks postimplant. Human and rat leptomeningeal cells were similar morphologically and were equally immunopositive for vimentin and fibronectin. Implanted human cells did not express the neuronal and glial proteins they had in vitro . Cells which hybridized with human DNA corresponded to the intensely Fast Blue positive cells. Small groups of human DNA hybridizing cells were also observed in the choroid plexus. Less intensely Fast Blue positive neurons and glia were found in the brain, but these hybridized with rat DNA. A minority of human leptomeningeal cells implanted into rat brain are subsequently found in host leptomeninges where they demonstrate properties characteristic of leptomeningeal fibroblasts. Small numbers of implanted cells can survive for two weeks.",

    "abstract": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been found to increase neuronal survival and neurite extension in a highly purified population of fetal rat hippocampal neurons under well-defined serum-free cell culture conditions. In the presence of FGF, neuronal survival after 7 days in culture on a simple plastic substrate is increased 4-fold, to 54% of the initial population. Survival is increased 2-fold to 40% on polyornithine-laminin. When FGF was bound to plastic or heparin substrates, neurite outgrowth was significantly increased to lengths comparable to those seen with laminin; however, FGF produced no further increase in neurite outgrowth on laminin. Half-maximal survival was observed at FGF concentrations of about 15 pg/ml (1 pM); half-maximal process outgrowth occurred at about 375 pg/ml (20 pM). The responsive cells were identified as neurons by their labeling with tetanus toxin and by antibodies to neurofilaments and to the neuron-specific enolase. Astrocytes, identified by the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein, constituted about 10% of cells present at 1 week both in the presence and in the absence of FGF. These results strongly suggest that, in addition to its known mitogenic effects on nonneuronal cells, FGF possesses neurotrophic activity for hippocampal neurons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Dissociated 8\u2010day chick embryo ciliary ganglionic neurons will not survive for even 24 h in culture without the addition of specific supplements. One such supplement is a protein termed the ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) which is present at very high concentrations within intraocular tissues that contain the same muscle cells innervated by ciliary ganglionic neurons in vivo. We describe here the purification of chick eye CNTF by a 2\u00bd\u2010day procedure involving the processing of intraocular tissue extract sequentially through DE52 ion\u2010exchange chromatography, membrane ultrafiltration\u2010concentration, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gradient electrophoresis. An aqueous extract of the tissue from 300 eyes will yield about 10\u201320 \u03bcg of biologically active, electrophoretically pure CNTF with a specific activity of 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 trophic units/mg protein. Purified CNTF has an M r of 20,400 daltons and an isoelectric point of about 5, as determined by analytical gel electrophoresis. In addition to supporting the survival of ciliary ganglion neurons, purified CNTF also supports the 24\u2010h survival of cultured neurons from certain chick and rodent sensory and sympathetic ganglia. CNTF differs from mouse submaxillary nerve growth factor (NGF) in molecular weight, isoelectric point, inability to be inactivated by antibodies to NGF, ability to support the in vitro survival of the ciliary ganglion neurons, and inability to support that of 8\u2010day chick embryo dorsal root ganglionic neurons. Thus, CNTF represents the first purified neuronotrophic factor which addresses parasympathetic cholinergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) remains a leading preventable cause of structural birth defects and permanent neurodevelopmental disability. The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a powerful embryological research model, and was possibly the first in which the teratogenicity of alcohol was demonstrated. Pharmacologically relevant exposure to alcohol in the range of 20-70 mmol/L (20-80 mg/egg) disrupt the growth of chicken embryos, morphogenesis, and behavior, and the resulting phenotypes strongly parallel those of mammalian models. The avian embryo's direct accessibility has enabled novel insights into the teratogenic mechanisms of alcohol. These include the contribution of IGF1 signaling to growth suppression, the altered flow dynamics that reshape valvuloseptal morphogenesis and mediate its cardiac teratogenicity, and the suppression of Wnt and Shh signals thereby disrupting the migration, expansion, and survival of the neural crest, and underlie its characteristic craniofacial deficits. The genetic diversity within commercial avian strains has enabled the identification of unique loci, such as ribosome biogenesis, that modify vulnerability to alcohol. This venerable research model is equally relevant for the future, as the application of technological advances including CRISPR, optogenetics, and biophotonics to the embryo's ready accessibility creates a unique model in which investigators can manipulate and monitor the embryo in real-time to investigate the effect of alcohol on cell fate.",

    "abstract": "GABA (\u03b3-amino butyric acid) is the major inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous system and its action is terminated by specific transporters (GAT), found in neurons and glial cells. We have previously described that GAT-3 is responsible for GABA uptake activity in cultured avian M\u00fcller cells and that it operates in a Na(+) and Cl(-) dependent manner. Here we show that glutamate decreases [(3)H] GABA uptake in purified cultured glial cells up to 50%, without causing cell death. This effect is mediated by ionotropic glutamatergic receptors. Glutamate inhibition on GABA uptake is not reverted by inhibitors of protein kinase C or modified by agents that modulate cyclic AMP/PKA. Biotinylation experiments demonstrate that this reduction in GABA uptake correlates with a decrease in GAT-3 plasma membrane levels. Interestingly, both GAT-1 and GAT-3 mRNA levels are also decreased by glutamate. Conditioned media (CM) prepared from retinal neurons could also decrease GABA influx, and glutamate receptor antagonists (MK-801 + CNQX) were able to prevent this effect. However, glutamate levels in CM were not different from those found in fresh media, indicating that a glutamatergic co-agonist or modulator could be regulating GABA uptake by M\u00fcller cells in this scenario. In the whole avian retina, GAT-3 is present from embryonic day 5 (E5) increasing up to the end of embryonic development and post-hatch period exclusively in neuronal layers. However, this pattern may change in pathological conditions, which drive GAT-3 expression in M\u00fcller cells. Our data suggest that in purified cultures and upon extensive neuronal lesion in vivo, shown as a Brn3a reduced neuronal cells and an GFAP increased gliosis, M\u00fcller glia may change its capacity to take up GABA due to GAT-3 up regulation and suggests a regulatory interplay mediated by glutamate between neurons and glial cells in this process.",
