Some of the new commercially available media combinations allow for the growth of sparse populations of neurons, which in turn allow for the study of individual neurons and synapses. This has not been possible using serum-supplemented media without a feeder layer of glial cells. In serum-supplemented media, glial cells continue to multiply, necessitating the use of cytotoxic mitotic inhibitors (). Serum also contains unknown and variable levels of growth factors, hormones, vitamins, and proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Survival in monolayer culture of 4\u2010day (stage 23) chick embryo lumbar spinal cord neurons can be regulated by two opposing activities. One, spinal neuronotrophic activity, promotes neuronal survival; and the other, spinal neuronotoxic activity, eliminates the neurons from the culture even when the trophic support is present at an optimal concentration. Quantitative microbioassays for each activity are presented and used to measure the relative amounts of each agent within different sources including glial, muscle, and spinal cord cell\u2010conditioned media and fluid collected from peripheral and central nervous tissue lesions. Although both activities were present in all of the sources tested, their concentrations in the wound fluids were orders of magnitude greater than in the conditioned media. The fluid\u2010derived trophic activities were inactivated by heat and trypsin and nondialyzable, whereas all of the conditioned media\u2010derived trophic activities were heat\u2010 and trypsin\u2010resistant and dialyzable.",

    "title": "Serum\u2010free B27/neurobasal medium supports differentiated growth of neurons from the striatum, substantia nigra, septum, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and dentate gyrus",
    "abstract": "Abstract Two fundamental questions about neuron cell culture were addressed. Can one serum\u2010free medium that was developed for optimum growth of hippocampal neurons support the growth of neurons from other regions of the brain? Is the region specific state of differentiation maintained in culture? To answer these questions, we isolated neurons from six other rat brain regions, placed them in culture in B27/Neurobasal TM defined medium, and analyzed their morphology and growth dependence on cell density after 4 days in culture. Neuronal identity was confirmed by immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament 200. Neurons from each brain region maintained distinctive morphologies in culture in the virtual absence of glia. Cells isolated from embryonic day 18 cerebral cortex by digestion with papain showed the same high survival as hippocampal neurons, e.g., 70% survival for cells plated at 160/mm 2 . At this age and density, neurons from the septum showed slightly lower survival, 45%. Survival of dentate granule neurons from postnatal day four brains was 30\u201040%, significantly lower, and relatively independent of plating density. This suggests an absence of dependence on trophic factors or contact for dentate granule neurons. Growth of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal day 7, 8, or 9 brains in B27/Neurobasal was compared to growth in BME/10% serum. Viability in serum\u2010free medium at 4 days was much better than that in serum, did not require KCI elevated to 25 mM, and occurred without substantial growth of glia. Cerebellar granule neurons plated at 1,280 cells/mm 2 were maintained in culture for three weeks with 17 of the original cell density surviving. Survival of cells isolated from embryonic day 18 substantia nigra was 50% at 160 cells/mm 2 after 4 days, similar to that of striatum, but slightly less than hippocampal neuron survival. The dopaminergic phenotype of the substantia nigral neurons was maintained over 2 weeks in culture as judged by immunoreactivity with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. During this time, immunoreactivity was found in the processes as they grew out from the soma. Together, these studies suggest that B27/Neurobasal will be a useful medium for maintaining the differentiated growth of neurons from many brain regions. Potential applications of a common growth medium for different neurons are discussed. \u00a9 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

Survival and growth of chick flat cells required fetal calf, but not horse serum.

    "abstract": "Abstract We have previously demonstrated that both peripheral and central neurons from 8 day embryonic chick and newborn mouse can be maintained in a serum\u2010free medium using the N1 supplement consisting of insulin, transferrin, putrescine, progesterone, and selenite. In the present studies we show that dorsal root ganglionic (DRG) neurons from embryonic chick (E7\u2013E15) and neonatal mouse can be cultured in a serum\u2010free environment with only the addition of insulin and transferrin, plus Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). Chick DRG from E10\u2013E15 contain a population of neurons sensitive to a chick embryo eye\u2010derived ganglionic neuronotrophic factor (GNTF), which is distinct from the neuronal subset dependent upon NGF. The GNTF\u2010dependent chick neurons can also be maintained in culture with insulin and transferrin supplements. Neonatal mouse DRG neurons, whether supported by NGF or eye\u2010derived GNTF, likewise survive in serum\u2010free medium with only insulin and transferrin. Limited numbers of neurons survive for the first 24 hours in a serum\u2010free medium lacking insulin or transferrin, but failed to display neurite outgrowth even in the presence of added trophic factor.",

When this ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) was concentrated using ultrafiltration and subjected to Sephadex G100 and G200 chromatography, activity was detected in most of the eluted fractions. A peak of the most active fractions was eluted in a region corresponding to a molecular weight of 35\u201340 \u00b1 10 3 and contained about 20\u201030% of the applied protein. CNTF activity bound readily to DE\u201052 cellulose resin at neutral pH and was eluted with NaCl in a narrow region containing about 20\u201040% of the applied protein. Gel electrophoretic staining profiles of the active DE52 fraction indicated considerable (but still only partial) simplification in protein composition. While significant CNTF activity losses were incurred in response to each of the above treatments, an active material could be conveniently generated in one working day in milligram amounts having a specific activity of 60,000 trophic units/mg protein. This trophic activity is in the same range as that of the only other known neuronotrophic factor, Nerve Growth Factor.",

    "abstract": "Conditioned media from glial cell cultures contain low molecular weight agents which can support survival of CNS neurons in the absence of recognized protein neuronotrophic factors. A similar support is provided to CNS neurons by selected basal media, and pyruvate is the critical medium constituent responsible for their trophic competence. Eagle's basal medium, which contains no pyruvate, acquires pyruvate when conditioned over astroglial cell cultures. Enzymatic degradation of the pyruvate in the astroglia-conditioned medium leads to corresponding losses in its low molecular weight trophic activity for CNS neurons. Quantitative correlations between pyruvate content and CNS trophic activity demonstrate that pyruvate is the main trophic ingredient of the glia-conditioned medium, and other low molecular weight substances, acquired during conditioning, reduce the pyruvate concentration required for its trophic effect. The \"pyruvate-sparing\" substances, as yet unidentified, are not the serine and Fe3+ which have pyruvate-sparing competence for peripheral, ciliary ganglionic neurons. These findings, together with previous observations, propose that prenatal neurons fail to generate or retain endogenous pyruvate at the levels for their survival-sustaining activities.",

    "title": "Sensory neurons in culture: Changing requirements for survival factors during embryonic development",
    "abstract": "The effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) and medium conditioned by glioma cells (GCM) on the survival of chicken sensory neurons in culture was investigated. Neurons were isolated from embryos 8 days (E8) to 16 days (E16) old and the proportion of surviving neurons was determined after 2 days in culture. In the absence of NGF or GCM, essentially no neurons survived at any age. In the presence of NGF, survival increased from 25% of the neurons at E8 to 40% between E10 and E12 and then decreased to background level (5%) at E16. In contrast, in the presence of GCM, survival increased continuously from 10% of the neurons at E8 to 75% at E16. At early developmental stages, the effect of NGF and GCM together was greater than the sum of their individual effects: at E8, about 80% of the neurons survived, double the number expected for a simple additive effect. Thus, a significant proportion of chicken neurons from dorsal root ganglia require both NGF and GCM for survival, and this may well include neurons from the ventro-lateral population, which do not respond to NGF alone. As neurons matured, the double requirement progressively decreased and, by E16, NGF no longer increased the number of neurons over that surviving in response to GCM alone. The facts that rat brain extracts mimicked the effect of GCM and that the potency of the brain extracts of rat in the postnatal period increased in parallel with the development of the glial cells suggest that glial cells produce a factor(s) both immunologically and functionally different from NGF which supports the survival of sensory neurons.",

    "title": "Optimized survival of hippocampal neurons in B27\u2010supplemented neurobasal\u2122, a new serum\u2010free medium combination",
    "abstract": "We have systematically optimized the concentrations of 20 components of a previously published serum-free medium (Brewer and Cotman, Brain Res 494: 65-74, 1989) for survival of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons after 4 days in culture. This serum-free medium supplement, B27, produced neuron survival above 60%, independent of plating density above 160 plated cells/mm2. For isolated cells (< 100 cells/mm2), survival at 4 days was still above 45%, but could be rescued to the 60% level at 40 cells/mm2 by simply applying a coverslip on top of the cells. This suggests a need for additional trophic factors. High survival was achieved with osmolarity lower than found in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), and by reducing cysteine and glutamine concentrations and by the elimination of toxic ferrous sulphate found in DME/F12. Neurobasal is a new medium that incorporates these modifications to DMEM. In B27/Neurobasal, glial growth is reduced to less than 0.5% of the nearly pure neuronal population, as judged by immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuron-specific enolase. Excellent long-term viability is achieved after 4 weeks in culture with greater than 90% viability for cells plated at 640/mm2 and greater than 50% viability for cells plated at 160/mm2. Since the medium also supports the growth of neurons from embryonic rat striatum, substantia nigra, septum, and cortex, and neonatal dentate gyrus and cerebellum (Brewer, in preparation), support for other neuron types is likely. B27/Neurobasal should be useful for in vitro studies of neuronal toxicology, pharmacology, electrophysiology, gene expression, development, and effects of growth factors and hormones.",
