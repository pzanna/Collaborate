    "title": "High associative neuron numbers could drive cognitive performance in corvid species",
    "abstract": "Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. However, how these species with their small brains achieve such feats remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that cognitive capabilities could be based on the total numbers of telencephalic neurons. Here we extend this hypothesis further and posit that especially high neuron counts in associative pallial areas drive flexible, complex cognition. If true, avian species like corvids should specifically accumulate neurons in the avian associative areas meso- and nidopallium. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the neuronal composition of telencephalic areas in corvids and noncorvids (chicken, pigeons, and ostriches-the species with the largest bird brain). The overall number of pallial neurons in corvids was much higher than in chicken and pigeons and comparable to those of ostriches. However, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids and, in correlation with these associative areas, the corvid subpallium also contained high neuron numbers. These findings support our hypothesis that large absolute numbers of associative pallial neurons contribute to cognitive flexibility and complexity and are key to explain why crows are smart. Since meso-/nidopallial and subpallial areas scale jointly, it is conceivable that associative pallio-striatal loops play a similar role in executive decision making as described in primates.",

When this ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) was concentrated using ultrafiltration and subjected to Sephadex G100 and G200 chromatography, activity was detected in most of the eluted fractions. A peak of the most active fractions was eluted in a region corresponding to a molecular weight of 35\u201340 \u00b1 10 3 and contained about 20\u201030% of the applied protein. CNTF activity bound readily to DE\u201052 cellulose resin at neutral pH and was eluted with NaCl in a narrow region containing about 20\u201040% of the applied protein. Gel electrophoretic staining profiles of the active DE52 fraction indicated considerable (but still only partial) simplification in protein composition. While significant CNTF activity losses were incurred in response to each of the above treatments, an active material could be conveniently generated in one working day in milligram amounts having a specific activity of 60,000 trophic units/mg protein. This trophic activity is in the same range as that of the only other known neuronotrophic factor, Nerve Growth Factor.",

    "abstract": "There is pronounced seasonal plasticity in the morphology of the neural circuits that regulate song behavior in adult songbirds, primarily in response to changes in plasma testosterone (T) levels. Most song nuclei have androgen receptors. Afferent input from the telencephalic nucleus HVc (also known as the \"high vocal center\") is necessary for seasonal growth of the direct efferent target nuclei RA and area X. We asked here whether T-stimulated growth of HVc is sufficient to induce growth of its efferent nuclei. Intracerebral T implants were placed unilaterally near HVc or RA in photosensitive adult male white-crowned sparrows for one month. The T implant near HVc produced significant growth of the ipsilateral (but not contralateral) HVc, RA, and area X, and increased neuronal number in the ipsilateral HVc. The T implant near RA did not produce selective growth of ipsilateral RA, HVc, or area X. Intracerebral T implants did not elevate plasma T levels, nor did they stimulate growth of two peripheral androgen sensitive targets, the syrinx and the cloacal protuberance. These results suggest that seasonal growth of the adult song circuits results from T acting directly on HVc, which then stimulates the growth of RA and area X transynaptically.",

    "abstract": "The song system of oscine birds has frequently been presented as a model system for motor learning in vertebrates. This practice has been bolstered by the growing recognition that one part of the song system that is essential for song learning, area X, is a component of the avian striatum. The mammalian striatum, the input structure of the basal ganglia, has been implicated in a number of motor-related functions, including motor learning, suggesting that song learning in birds and motor learning in mammals may use similar physiological mechanisms. We studied the intrinsic physiological properties of area X neurons in brain slices to see how closely they match properties identified in mammalian striatal neurons and to collect data that are necessary to understand how area X processes information. We found that area X contains all four physiological cell types present in the mammalian striatum and that each is very similar to its mammalian counterpart. We also found a fifth cell type in area X that has not been reported in mammalian striatum; instead, this cell type resembles neurons that have been recorded in the mammalian globus pallidus. This pallidum-like cell type morphologically resembles the projection neurons of area X. We suggest that area X contains a pathway equivalent to the \"direct\" striatopallidothalamic pathway through the mammalian basal ganglia, with the striatal and pallidal components intermingled in one nucleus.",

    "title": "Organization and evolution of the avian forebrain",
    "abstract": "Abstract Early 20th\u2010century comparative anatomists regarded the avian telencephalon as largely consisting of a hypertrophied basal ganglia, with thalamotelencephalic circuitry thus being taken to be akin to thalamostriatal circuitry in mammals. Although this view has been disproved for more than 40 years, only with the recent replacement of the old telencephalic terminology that perpetuated this view by a new terminology reflecting more accurate understanding of avian brain organization has the modern view of avian forebrain organization begun to become more widely appreciated. The modern view, reviewed in the present article, recognizes that the avian basal ganglia occupies no more of the telencephalon than is typically the case in mammals, and that it plays a role in motor control and motor learning as in mammals. Moreover, the vast majority of the telencephalon in birds is pallial in nature and, as true of cerebral cortex in mammals, provides the substrate for the substantial perceptual and cognitive abilities evident among birds. While the evolutionary relationship of the pallium of the avian telencephalon and its thalamic input to mammalian cerebral cortex and its thalamic input remains a topic of intense interest, the evidence currently favors the view that they had a common origin from forerunners in the stem amniotes ancestral to birds and mammals. \u00a9 2005 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The higher vocal center (HVc) of the canary brain projects to two forebrain nuclei: robustus archistriatalis (RA) and area X of lobus parolfactorius. The time of birth of HVc neurons projecting to these two regions was determined by combining [3H]thymidine autoradiography and retrograde fluorogold uptake. Birds were sacrificed at 13 months of age, 4 days after fluorogold injections into area X or RA. A single injection of [3H]thymidine in ovo (embryonic day 9) labeled 76% of area X-projecting cells and 0.8% of cells projecting to RA. The great majority of RA-projecting cells were produced during posthatching development (posthatching day 10-240; P10-P240), with a peak at P60 and a hiatus at P120. HVc reaches full adult size by P240, yet at that age the production of new RA-projecting cells continued at a rate comparable to that recorded during posthatching development. Late production of neurons interconnecting two distant regions of the brain may regulate source to target cell population size. Male canaries start to sing at P40. During subsequent months, they imitate external models and their song becomes more structured and stereotyped. At sexual maturity (P240), song is stable. Three interpretations are offered: (i) neurogenesis of RA-projecting cells is related to learning, and learning continues even after achievement of pattern stability; (ii) neurogenesis of RA-projecting cells is not related to learning; (iii) the production of RA-projecting cells serves different purposes during development and after sexual maturity.",

Both active and inactive areas for evoked vocalizations as determined from 821 electrode penetrations were plotted. An apparently continuous system, active for vocalization, extends from the preoptic region rostrally to the most caudal portion of the medulla posteriorly. All portions of the striatum and spinal cord sampled were negative for vocalizations at the stimulus intensity used. Thresholds were lowest; calling was the most natural sounding and was elicited in the absence of other behavior in the area ventro-medial to the inferior colliculus. Most of the brain yielded only repetitive vocalizations ranging from brief ''cuk'' sounds to longer duration squawk sounds similar to those given by normal chickens. In the medulla both repetitive sounds in response to continuous stimulation and single protracted sounds per stimulation were evoked. Both types of vocalization could be elicited from the same site by varying the stimulus intensity. In portions of the midbrain, pons and medulla vocalization substrates corresponded to areas reported to yield respiratory responses in this and other species. Results are in agreement with those reported for chronically-implanted awake birds and are interpreted to suggest a single set of neural mechanisms controlling the production of vocalizations.",

    "abstract": "We have traced central nervous pathways controlling bird song in the canary using a combination of behavioral and anatomical techniques. Unilateral electrolytic brain lesions were made in adult male canaries whose song had been previously recorded and analysed on a sound spectrograph. After several days of postoperative recording, the birds were sacrificed and their brains processed histologically for degeneration staining with the Fink-Heimer technique. Although large lesions in the neostriatum and rostral hyperstriatum had no effect on song, severe song deficits followed damage to a discrete large-celled area in the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (HVc). Degenerating fibers were traced from this region to two other discrete nuclei in the forebrain: one in the parolfactory lobe (area X, a teardrop-shaped small-celled nucleus); and a round large-celled nucleus in the archistriatum (RA). Unilateral lesion of X had no effect on song; lesions of RA, however, caused severe song deficits. Degenerating fibers from RA joined the occipitomesencephalic tract and had widespread ipsilateral projections to the thalamus, nucleus intercollicularis of the midbrain, reticular formation, and medulla. It is of particular interest that direct connections were found onto the cells of the motor nucleus innervating the syrinx, the organ of song production. Unilateral lesions of n. intercollicularis (previously implicated in the control of vocal behavior) had little effect on song. One bilateral lesion of HVc resulted in permanent (9 months) and complete elimination of the audible components of song, although the bird assumed the posture and movements typical of song. Preliminary data suggest that lesions of the left hemisphere result in greater deficits than lesions of the right one. This finding is consistent with earlier reports that the left syrinx controls the majority of song components. Results reported here suggest a localization of vocal control in the canary brain with an overlying left hemispheric dominance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous work in songbirds has delimited a neural system responsible for song production and control. Earlier studies have suggested that functional capacity in the song system may be related to the mass of the system in an animal's brain, and that adult plasticity in this neural system may be related to adult capacity for behavioral modification. We now test these hypotheses in adult red\u2010winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ), a species in which song is produced primarily by males, new song types are added to the male's repertoire in adulthood, and there are substantial differences among males in song complexity. We find that the song system in males is much larger than in females. Song system nuclei become smaller in both sexes as the animals experience shorter days. We do not find any association between repertoire size and size of any of the song system structures examined. Thus, although sex differences in song may be related to differences between sexes in the mass of song system structures, individual differences in song do not appear to be directly related to mass within males. Seasonal change in song system structures in male redwings is consistent with there being a relation between adult plasticity in anatomy and in behavior; the large seasonal change in these structures in females suggests large seasonal changes in the function of these nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The pattern of primary auditory projections to the brain stem of young chickens was investigated using terminal degeneration methods and orthograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or tritiated amino acid. Of particular interest was the question of whether nucleus laminaris (NL) receives primary afferents. A study of silver\u2010stained degeneration patterns in nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and NL at three intervals following unilateral interruption of the cochlear nerve revealed that by 48 hours after the lesion, degenerating terminals were found only in the ipsilateral nucleus angularis (NA), NM and lagenar projection areas but not in NL. Five\u2010 and eight\u2010day survival times, however, also revealed degeneration bilaterally in NL. The appearance of terminal degeneration in NL at the longer survival times is attributed to the previously\u2010reported severe and rapid transneuronal degeneration of neurons in NM following deafferentation and not to the presence of cochlear nerve terminals in NL. Injection of HRP or tritiated proline into the basilar papilla produced patterns of labeling similar to that seen in the 2\u2010day degeneration material; HRP reaction product or autoradiographic label were seen only in the ipsilateral NA and NM and in the ipsilateral projection areas of the macula lagena but not in either NL. The patterns of primary auditory projections revealed by the three methods were quite similar to each other and to that previously reported for the pigeon and confirm the conclusion that the laminar nucleus of chickens does not receive primary afferents.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, principal neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) exhibit biophysical specializations that enable them to detect sound localization cues with microsecond precision. In the present study, we used whole-cell patch recordings to examine the development of the intrinsic electrical properties of these neurons in brainstem slices from postnatal day 14 (P14) to P38 gerbils. In the week after hearing onset (P14-P21), we observed dramatic reductions in somatic EPSP duration, input resistance, and membrane time constant. Surprisingly, somatically recorded action potentials also dramatically declined in amplitude over a similar period (38 +/- 3 to 17 +/- 2 mV; tau = 5.2 d). Simultaneous somatic and dendritic patch recordings revealed that these action potentials were initiated in the axon, which primarily emerged from the soma. In older gerbils, the rapid speed of membrane voltage changes and the attenuation of action potential amplitudes were mediated extensively by low voltage-activated potassium channels containing the Kv1.1 subunit. In addition, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings revealed that these potassium channels increase nearly fourfold from P14 to P23 and are thus a major component of developmental changes in excitability. Finally, the electrophysiological features of principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body did not change after P14, indicating that posthearing regulation of intrinsic membrane properties is not a general feature of all time-coding auditory neurons. We suggest that the striking electrical segregation of the axon from the soma and dendrites of MSO principal neurons minimizes spike-induced distortion of synaptic potentials and thus preserves the accuracy of binaural comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Telencephalic organization in birds is so unusual that many homologies between avian and mammalian telencephalic areas remain controversial. Particularly contested is the avian \"neostriatum,\" which has historically been homologized to either mammalian striatum, lateral neocortex, or endopiriform claustrum. Because homologies between these adult structures have been so difficult to resolve, we have begun to examine how telencephalic development diverges between birds and other vertebrates. To this end, biotinylated dextran was injected into the lateral telencephalon of chick embryos at 3 d of incubation, and the distribution of labeled cells was examined up to 14 d later. The data show that a definite boundary to cellular migration develops just ventral to the neostriatum between 5 and 8 d of incubation. Labeled polyclones within the neostriatum stretch from the ventricular zone to the brain surface and exhibit an increasingly rostrocaudal orientation as development proceeds. Individual polyclones contribute cells to several of the distinct auditory, visual, somatosensory, and olfactory regions within the neostriatum. A comparative analysis suggests that the avian neostriatum develops from a precursor region that in other vertebrates gives rise to olfactory cortex and, when present, to other components of the piriform lobe, such as the endopiriform claustrum and basolateral amygdala. Conclusions about lateral pallial homologies between birds and mammals remain uncertain, however, primarily because so little is known about the development of the lateral pallium in mammals. This lacuna might be filled by applying to mammals the novel fate-mapping method described in the present paper.",

The mechanisms that control this natural plasticity are poorly understood. To determine how quickly and in what sequence the song nuclei respond to changing daylength and circulating T, we captured 18 adult male white-crowned sparrows and kept them on short days for 12 weeks. We killed five of these birds and exposed the rest to long days (LD) and elevated T. We killed these birds either 7 or 20 d after LD + T exposure. We measured song nuclei volumes and cellular attributes, the mass of the vocal production organ (the syrinx), and song behavior. The neostriatal song control nucleus HVC (also known as \u201chigh vocal center\u201d), added 50,000 neurons and increased in size within 7 d of exposure to LD + T. Efferent targets of HVC, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), and area X of the parolfactory lobe grew more slowly and were not significantly larger until day 20 of the study. The tracheosyringeal portion of the hypoglossal nucleus (nXIIts), which receives projections from RA and normally grows in response to seasonal cues, did not grow over the time course of this study. Syringeal mass increased within 7 d of LD + T treatment. The anatomical changes in the brain were accompanied by behavioral changes in song production. On day 7 when the song circuitry was incompletely developed, male sparrows sang less stereotyped songs than males at day 20 with more completely developed song circuits. These results suggest that the song circuitry responds rapidly and sequentially to breeding-typical conditions (long days and elevated T), and that song stereotypy increases as nuclei within this circuitry grow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nucleus laminaris (NL) is a third\u2010order auditory nucleus in the avian brain stem which receives spatially segregated binaural inputs from the second\u2010order nuclei magnocellularis. The examination of the development of dendritic structure in NL revealed a number of events: In the initial period of dendritic growth (E 8\u20139) there is no gradient of dendritic morphology or apparent size. Starting about E 9\u201310, there is a spatiotemporal gradient of proliferation of numerous fine dendritic processes, from rostromedial to caudolateral, corresponding with the morphological lamination of NL, and possibly with the onset of cell death. This is followed by a spatiotemporal gradient of the elimination of the overproliferated processes, from rostromedial to caudolateral, possibly coinciding with the cessation of cell death. A result of the spatiotemporal gradients of dendritic process proliferation and elimination is a spatial gradient in the morphology (extension, branching) of the remaining \u201cmature\u201d dendrites. At E 15 there is only a slight spatial gradient of total dendritic size across NL; this gradient is larger at E 19, and by P 25 there is a 13\u2010fold change in dendritic size from rostromedial to caudolateral. Regression analyses suggest the size gradient begins to form when NL activity becomes driven by cochlear activity, at about E 14. The progressive formation of the size gradient is largely the result of two factors: the growth of dendritic trees, and the loss of primary dendrites. The growth rate of the dendritic trees of NL cells was found to be very highly correlated with the intensities of the sound frequencies to which the cells respond. From E 15 to P 25 there is a 50% loss of the \u201cmature\u201d primary dendrites of NL neurons. The separate dorsal and ventral dendritic size gradients seen at E 15 realign to coincide at E 19, and the moderate correlation of dorsal and ventral dendritic sizes seen at E 15 and E 19 is significantly increased at P 25, indicating a developmental process of sharpening in the relationship of the dorsal and ventral dendritic organizations in the nucleus. The data suggest that a key element in the regulation of dendritic size and structure in n. laminaris may be the activity of the afferents to the cells.",

We tested the roles of experience and behavior in seasonal plasticity of the neural circuits that regulate learned song behavior in adult songbirds. Neurons in these circuits receive auditory input and show selective auditory responses to conspecific song. We asked whether auditory input or song production contribute to seasonal growth of telencephalic song nuclei. Adult male Gambel9s white-crowned sparrows were surgically deafened, which eliminates auditory input and greatly reduces song production. These birds were then exposed to photoperiod and hormonal conditions that regulate the growth of song nuclei. We measured the volumes of the nuclei HVC, robust nucleus of arcopallium (RA), and area X at 7 and 30 d after exposure to long days plus testosterone in deafened and normally hearing birds. We also assessed song production and examined protein kinase C (PKC) expression because previous research reported that immunostaining for PKC increases transiently after deafening. Deafening did not delay or block the growth of the song nuclei to their full breeding-condition size. PKC activity in RA was not altered by deafening in the sparrows. Song continued to be well structured for up to 10 months after deafening, but song production decreased almost eightfold. These results suggest that neither auditory input nor high rates of song production are necessary for seasonal growth of the adult song control system in this species.",

In two song nuclei, HVc and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), the optical disector yielded intergroup differences in neuron density and number that coincided well with the three previous reports. We also estimated neuron number and density with a random, systematic, nonstereological counting protocol that used the neuronal nucleolus as the unit of count. We compared this method directly to the optical disector. In all cases, the two neuron-counting methods produced similar estimates of neuron number and density; the differences between treatment groups were equally discernible regardless of the counting method used. This study confirms previously reported seasonal and sex differences in the HVc and the RA by use of stereology and indicates that a random, systematic, nonstereological neuron-counting protocol is accurate and is well suited to the study of these phenomena in the avian song control system.",

    "title": "Songbirds and the Revised Avian Brain Nomenclature",
    "abstract": "A bstract : It has become increasingly clear that the standard nomenclature for many telencephalic and related brainstem structures of the avian brain is based on flawed once\u2010held assumptions of homology to mammalian brain structures, greatly hindering functional comparisons between avian and mammalian brains. This has become especially problematic for those researchers studying the neurobiology of birdsong, the largest single group within the avian neuroscience community. To deal with the many communication problems this has caused among researchers specializing in different vertebrate classes, the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum, held at Duke University from July 18\u201020, 2002, set out to develop a new terminology for the avian telencephalon and some allied brainstem cell groups. In one major step, the erroneous conception that the avian telencephalon consists mainly of a hypertrophied basal ganglia has been purged from the telencephalic terminology, and the actual parts of the basal ganglia and its brainstem afferent cell groups have been given new names to reflect their now\u2010evident homologies. The telencephalic regions that were incorrectly named to reflect presumed homology to mammalian basal ganglia have been renamed as parts of the pallium. The prefixes used for the new names for the pallial subdivisions have retained most established abbreviations, in an effort to maintain continuity with the pre\u2010existing nomenclature. Here we present a brief synopsis of the inaccuracies in the old nomenclature, a summary of the nomenclature changes, and details of changes for specific songbird vocal and auditory nuclei. We believe this new terminology will promote more accurate understanding of the broader neurobiological implications of song control mechanisms and facilitate the productive exchange of information between researchers studying avian and mammalian systems.",

    "title": "Reversible developmental change in the ability of ciliary ganglion neurons to extend neurites in culture",
    "abstract": "From stages 35 to 40 in the chicken embryo, ciliary ganglion neurons undergo a developmental change which is detected in our assay system as a marked decline in the ability to extend neurites when placed in culture. This developmental loss is observed when the neurons are placed in culture as single, dissociated cells or as undissociated ganglion explants. The loss of the ability to extend neurites in culture is not a transitory phenomenon, for no recovery of this ability is observed during the rest of embryonic development or posthatching. There is a close temporal correlation between the embryonic period during which the ability of ciliary ganglion neurons to extend neurites declines and the period (stages 35 to 40) when these neurons form functional peripheral synapses in the embryo. The ability to extend neurites rapidly is not recovered during normal development as long as the ganglion and its connections within the organism remain intact. However, if the ciliary ganglia are removed from a stage 40 embryo and cultured for 3 to 4 days before being dissociated, the neurons have largely recovered their ability to initiate neurite outgrowth rapidly. This recovery after removal from the embryo is also presumably responsible for the eventual dense outgrowth of neurites from stage 40 ganglion explants after a 3- to 4-day delay in culture. Our results, in conjunction with similar results from other systems, suggest a cause and effect relationship between the establishment or disruption of peripheral connections and the loss or recovery, respectively, of the ability to extend neurites rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The brain of adult homeothermic vertebrates exhibits a higher degree of morphological neuroplasticity than previously thought, and this plasticity is especially prominent in birds. In particular, incorporation of new neurons is widespread throughout the adult avian forebrain, and the volumes of specific nuclei vary seasonally in a prominent manner. We review here work on steroid\u2010dependent plasticity in birds, based on two cases: the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) of Japanese quail in relation to male sexual behavior, and nucleus HVC in canaries, which regulates song behavior. In male quail, POM volume changes seasonally, and in castrated subjects testosterone almost doubles POM volume within 2 weeks. Significant volume increases are, however, already observable after 1 day. Steroid receptor coactivator\u20101 is part of the mechanism mediating these effects. Increases in POM volume reflect changes in cell size or spacing and dendritic branching, but are not associated with an increase in neuron number. In contrast, seasonal changes in HVC volume reflect incorporation of newborn neurons in addition to changes in cell size and spacing. These are induced by treatments with exogenous testosterone or its metabolites. Expression of doublecortin, a microtubule\u2010associated protein, is increased by testosterone in the HVC but not in the adjacent nidopallium, suggesting that neuron production in the subventricular zone, the birthplace of newborn neurons, is not affected. Together, these data illustrate the high degree of plasticity that extends into adulthood and is characteristic of avian brain structures. Many questions still remain concerning the regulation and specific function of this plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The responses of chick embryo retina neurons to the substratum-bound, neurite-promoting factor \"PNPF\" were studied using glia-free, purified neuronal monolayers. Polyornithine-coated dishes were exposed before cell seeding to either serum-containing culture medium (PNPF(-) substratum) or to the same medium supplemented with 25% rat schwannoma conditioned medium, a source of PNPF (PNPF(+) substratum). The dishes were thoroughly rinsed before receiving a suspension of 8 day chick embryo neural retina cells in serum-free medium. The presence of PNPF on the substratum determined a dramatic increase in the relative frequency of neurite-bearing cells in the cultures. After 6 hours in vitro PNPF(+) cultures contained 45% neurite-bearing cells as compared with 5-7% on PNPN(-) substrata. At 72 hours those values increased to 60% on PNPF(+) and to 40% on PNPF(-) substrata. PNPF(+) cultures also showed longer and/or more highly branched neurites, resulting in the formation of complex neurite networks. Moreover, a cell type characterized by the presence of a very long neurite could be seen on PNPF(+) but not on PNPF(-) substrata. Six hour cultures were used to analyze in more detail the response of retinal neurons to PNPF. Addition of fetal calf serum to the medium determined a concentration-dependent inhibition of neurite formation on PNPF(+) substrata. On the other hand, pretreatment of PNPF(+) substrata with concanavalin A also blocked the neurite-promoting effect of the factor. This concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of concanavalin A could be eliminated by the specific sugar alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. Wheat germ agglutinin, another lectin known to react with PNPF, did not cause any reduction in the neurite-promoting activity of this factor. Wheat germ agglutinin showed neurite-promoting properties of its own in control experiments using PNPF(-) substrata. The results indicate that the target spectrum of PNPF is broader than it was originally thought. Together with other reports from the literature, they also support the perception of neurite development as a cellular activity subject to complex regulatory mechanisms.",

The presynaptic calcium current is a low voltage-activated, noninactivating current and its block by omega-agatoxin IVA was not reversed by repeated depolarization of the presynaptic terminal.

Changes in the volume of one of the song control nuclei, robustus archistriatalis (RA), have been associated with seasonal changes in singing behavior in adult canaries (Serinus canarius) and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus). The present work assessed the effects of changed daylength on dendritic morphology in RA in adult male red-winged blackbirds. Brains from hand-reared red-winged blackbirds maintained on long days or long days followed by short days were stained with a Golgi-Cox procedure. Dendritic morphology and spine density of type IV neurons from nucleus RA were compared between long and short day birds. Neurons from short day birds have smaller dendritic fields than neurons from long day birds, with the difference greatest for distal dendrites. In addition, the density of dendritic spines is significantly smaller for neurons from short day birds. Together, these changes result in the loss of approximately 40% of the spines on this neuron class. In previous work in adult female canaries, external testosterone administration has been shown to be associated with increases in dendritic field size and synapse number. The similarity of the neuronal changes in RA that are associated with the two sorts of manipulations suggest that some consequences of altered daylength are mediated by changes in the levels of gonadal steroids.",

    "title": "The Neural Integration of Environmental Information by Seasonally Breeding Birds",
    "abstract": "SYNOPSIS. Songbirds show dramatic seasonal changes in their propensity to exhibit an endocrine response to environmental stimuli that regulate the timing of reproduction. There is a clear cycle in their ability to respond to changes in photoperiod but less is known about seasonal variation in their sensitivity to supplementary factors that augment the photo-induction of gonadal growth and fine tune the final onset of breeding. Such factors include behavioral interactions with a mate and the availability of a nest site. In birds, seasonal variations in the neural processing of photoperiod are mediated by substantial modifications in the availability of hypothalamic Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH). There is also evidence that the activity of certain monoamines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, changes in discrete parts of the hypothalamus as a function of the bird's photoperiodic condition. However, it is not known whether the response to supplementary factors involves similar changes. In this paper, I review what is known about how the avian central nervous system might integrate initial predictive information, such as photoperiod, and supplementary cues such as behavioral interactions. Photoperiodic information is perceived by an encephalic photoreceptor while supplementary stimuli are perceived by the visual and auditory systems. Both types of information seem to converge on the GnRH system of neurons in the preoptic area and the septum that regulate pituitary function. This suggests that future studies should concentrate on the connectivity of these GnRH positive cells to other parts of the central nervous system and on the regulation of GnRH activitiy in these cells by endogenous and exogenous factors.",

    "abstract": "The song control nuclei of songbirds undergo pronounced seasonal changes in size and neuronal attributes. The mechanisms by which seasonal changes in environmental variables such as photoperiod mediate seasonal changes in these brain regions are not known. Manipulations of photoperiod and/or testosterone in captive songbirds induce seasonal changes in the size of song nuclei comparable to those observed in wild songbirds. It is unclear, however, whether the effects of photoperiod on the song nuclei are mediated by testosterone or by steroid-independent mechanisms. We independently manipulated photoperiod and testosterone in castrated male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) to determine the contributions of steroid-dependent and -independent actions of photoperiod to seasonal changes in the size and neuronal attributes of song nuclei. Testosterone implants increased the size of several song nuclei, regardless of photoperiod. Photoperiod exerted small but significant steroid-independent effects on the volume of the higher vocal center and the size of neurons in the robust nucleus of the archistriatum. Photoperiod also modulated the effect of testosterone on the size of area X; testosterone treatment had a more pronounced effect on the size of area X on short days than on long days. These results suggest that although testosterone is the primary factor mediating seasonal changes in neural attributes of the song nuclei, photoperiod may act via mechanisms that are independent of steroid levels to supplement or modulate the actions of testosterone.",

In their mature form axons from the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), second\u2010order auditory neurons in the chicken brainstem, project bilaterally onto the NL. Axons from the ipsilateral and contralateral NM neurons from spatially segregated, elongated arbors in the dorsal and ventral neuropil of NL, respectively. The long axes of these arbors correspond to physiologically defined isofrequency bands To assess the development of this stereotyped arborization pattern, 6\u201317 day embryonic chicken brain stems were maintained in vitro while injecting horseradish peroxidase into small groups of axons. Three dimensional reconstructions were made from serial sections and projected onto a cartesian plane for quantitative analyses. At embryonic day 6 (E6), the ventral axons already course beneath the recently migrated NL neurons. The arrival of the dorsal NM axon branches is delayed and their paths are indirect. They first loop dorsally into the the ventricular layer, where they seem to make specific connections with migrating NL neurons and use these as guides to their appropriate positions in the NL. During the period from E9 to E17 the dorsal and ventral terminal fields become similar, each adopting properties of the other's initial pattern. The dorsal terminal fields extend to from bands similar to the early ventral terminal fields, while the ventral terminal fields narrow and appear to shift position in order to achieve the tonotopic specificity characteristic of the early dorsal terminal fields. The results show that a complex, mature pattern of neuronal connections can be formed during development by the combination and reorganization of two simple patterns\u2013each shaped, in turn, by its respective axonal trajectory.",

    "title": "Organization and development of brain stem auditory nuclei of the chicken: Dendritic gradients in nucleus laminaris",
    "abstract": "Abstract Nucleus laminaris (NL) is a third\u2010order auditory nucleus in the avian brain stem which received spatially\u2010segregated binaural inputs from the second\u2010order magnocellular nuclei. The organization of dendritic structure in NL was examined in Golgi\u2010impregnated brains from hatchling chickens. Quantitative analyses of dendritic size and number were made from camera lucida drawings of 135 neurons sampled from throughout the nucleus. The most significant results of this study may be summarized as follows: The preponderant neuron in n. laminaris may be characterized as having a cylindrical\u2010to\u2010ovoid cell body, about 20 \u03bcm in diameter. The neurons comprising NL were found to be nearly completely homogeneous in issuing their dendrites in a bipolar fashion: one group of dendrites is clustered on the dorsal surface of the cells, the other group on the ventral. The dendrites of NL are contained within the glia\u2010free neuropil surrounding the nucleus. From the rostromedial to the caudolateral poles of NL there is a gradient of increasing extension of the dendrites, increasing number of tertiary and higher\u2010order dendrites, and increasing distance from the somata of the occurrence of branching. The total dendritic size (sum of the dorsal and ventral dendritic lengths of the cells) increases 3\u2010fold from the rostromedial to the caudolateral poles of NL. About 50% of the variance in dendritic size is accounted for by the position of the cells in NL, and the gradient of dendritic size increase has the same orientation across NL as the tonotopic gradient of decreasing characteristic frequency in NL. From the rostromedial pole to the caudolateral pole of NL there is an 11\u2010fold decrease in the number of primary dendrites along a gradient coinciding with the length and frequency gradients. Sixty\u2010six percent of the variance in dendrite number is accounted for by position in the nucleus. The correlation of dorsal and ventral dendritic size on a cell\u2010by\u2010cell basis is not high (r = 0.47), indicating a fair amount of variability on the single\u2010cell level. On the other hand, the average dorsal dendritic length within an isofrequency band in NL correlates very highly with the average ventral dendritic length. Thus, on an areal basis, the amount of dendritic surface area offered to the dorsal and ventral afferents is tightly regulated. The dorsal and ventral dendrites have separate gradients of increasing length and number across NL. The dorsal gradients are skewed toward the rostrocaudal axis, while the ventral dendritic gradients are skewed mediolaterally. There was no correlation between either dendritic size or number of primary dendrites and the size of the somata in NL, which remains relatively constant throughout the nucleus. Several hypotheses about the ontogenetic control of dendritic structure are examined in light of the above data. Of these, the hypotheses that the ontogeny of dendritic size and number is largely under afferent control receives a great deal of circumstantial support.",

Type II neurons could be divided into two subclasses by the absence (IIa; 22 cells) and the presence (IIb; 8 cells) of a low-threshold transient depolarization. Type IIa neurons had relatively small somata and thin, spiny dendrites. The axons of some of the neurons in this class projected in the direction of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA). Type IIb neurons had relatively large somata and thick dendrites with many spines. Type III neurons (6 of 65 cells) had a shorter action-potential duration than the other classes. They exhibited prominent time-dependent inward rectification and a regular tonic firing with little or no accommodation. Type III neurons had beaded, aspiny dendrites. Type IV neurons (8 of 65 cells) had a longer action-potential duration, a much larger input resistance, and longer membrane time constant than the other classes.

To examine the cellular properties that permit NM neurons to transmit reliably the temporal characteristics of the acoustic stimulus, we performed whole-cell recordings in neurons of the chick NM using an in vitro thin slice preparation. NM neurons exhibited strong outward rectification near resting potential; the voltage responses to depolarizing current steps were substantially smaller than to equivalent hyperpolarizing steps. Suprathreshold current steps evoked only a single action potential at the start of the step. In contrast, stimulation with trains of brief current pulses evoked repetitive firing that was phase-locked to the stimulus cycle. The number of action potentials evoked by the pulses during the train decreased with increasing stimulus rate. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed a rapidly activating, slowly inactivating, outward current with a threshold near -65 mV. During depolarizing voltage steps, the outward current rose sigmoidally to a peak and then decayed slowly, reaching steady state within 5 sec. Application of 200 microM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) reduced the peak of the outward current by 84%, leaving a small, persistent component. Under current clamp, application of 200 microM 4-AP reduced the outward rectification and increased the amplitude and duration of the action potentials. Moreover, NM neurons could no longer sustain firing during high rates of stimulation with the current pulses: increased temporal summation of the potentials caused sufficient depolarization to inactivate the sodium conductance underlying the action potential. These results suggest that the outward current is necessary for NM neurons to transmit well-timed events reliably for the duration of an acoustic stimulus.",

    "abstract": "The avian caudolateral neostriatum (NCL) was first identified on the basis of its dense dopaminergic innervation. This fact and data from lesion studies have led to the notion that NCL might be the avian equivalent of prefrontal cortex (PFC). A key feature of the PFC is the ability to integrate information from all modalities needed for the generation of motor plans. By using antero- and retrograde pathway tracing techniques, we investigated the organization of sensory afferents to the NCL and the connections with limbic and somatomotor centers in the basal ganglia and archistriatum. Data from all tracing experiments were compared with the distribution of tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive fibers, serving as a marker of dopaminergic innervation. The results show that NCL is reciprocally connected with the secondary sensory areas of all modalities and with at least two parasensory areas. Retrograde tracing also demonstrated further afferents from the deep layers of the Wulst and from the frontolateral neostriatum as well as the sources of thalamic input. Efferents of NCL project onto parts of the avian basal ganglia considered to serve somatomotor or limbic functions. Projections to the archistriatum are mainly directed to the somatomotor part of the intermediate archistriatum. In addition, cells in caudal NCL were found to be connected with the ventral and posterior archistriatum, which are considered avian equivalents of mammalian amygdala. All afferents and projection neurons were confined to the plexus of densest TH innervation. Our results show that the NCL is positioned to amalgamate information from all modalities and to exert control over limbic and somatomotor areas. This organization might comprise the neural basis for such complex behaviours as working memory or spatial orientation. J. Comp. Neurol. 407:228\u2013260, 1999. \u00a9 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In the basal ganglia, numerous medium\u2010sized neurons throughout the striatum were labeled for GABA, while pallidal neurons, as well as a small population of large, aspiny striatal neurons, labeled for GAD and GABA. GAD+ and GABA+ fibers and terminals were abundant throughout the basal ganglia, and GABAergic fibers were found in all extratelencephalic targets of the basal ganglia. Most of these targets also contained numerous GABAergic neurons. In pallial regions, approximately 10\u201012% of the neurons were GABAergic. The outer rind of the pallium was more intensely labeled for GABAergic fibers than the core. The olfactory tubercle region, the ventral pallidum, and the hypothalamus were extremely densely labeled for GABAergic fibers, while GABAergic neurons were unevenly distributed in the hypothalamus. GABAergic neurons and fibers were abundant in the dorsalmost part of thalamus and the dorsal geniculate region, while GABAergic neurons and fibers were sparse (or lightly labeled) in the thalamic nuclei rotundus, triangularis, and ovoidalis. Further, GABAergic neurons were abundant in the superficial tectal layers, the magnocellular isthmic nucleus, the inferior colliculus, the intercollicular region, the central gray, and the reticular formation. GABAergic fibers were particularly abundant in the superficial tectal layers, the parvocellular isthmic nucleus, the inferior colliculus, the intercol\u2010licular region, the central gray, and the interpeduncular nucleus. These results suggest that GABA plays a role as a neurotransmitter in nearly all fore\u2010 and midbrain regions of birds, and in many instances the observed distributions of GABAergic neurons and fibers closely resemble the patterns seen in mammals, as well as in other vertebrates. \u00a9 1994 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

    "title": "Why birds are smart",
    "abstract": "Many cognitive neuroscientists believe that both a large brain and an isocortex are crucial for complex cognition. Yet corvids and parrots possess non-cortical brains of just 1-25 g, and these birds exhibit cognitive abilities comparable with those of great apes such as chimpanzees, which have brains of about 400 g. This opinion explores how this cognitive equivalence is possible. We propose four features that may be required for complex cognition: a large number of associative pallial neurons, a prefrontal cortex (PFC)-like area, a dense dopaminergic innervation of association areas, and dynamic neurophysiological fundaments for working memory. These four neural features have convergently evolved and may therefore represent 'hard to replace' mechanisms enabling complex cognition.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity in the hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) is associated with and necessary for the production of song by songbirds. HVc neurons also respond to acoustic stimuli. The present investigation assessed the auditory response properties of neurons in HVc by testing with the individual bird's own (autogenous) song and the songs of conspecific birds. Throughout HVc, multiunit clusters preferentially responded to autogenous song. Selectivity for autogenous song was apparent even when compared to similar intradialect songs, and neuronal clusters preferred autogenous song over the (tutor) song model that birds heard during the impressionable phase early in life. The responses to autogenous song were stable in the adult. HVc neurons were sensitive to the acoustic parameters of autogenous song and consistently exhibited a diminished response to modified song. In contrast, field L neurons, which are presumed to be a source of auditory input to HVc, did not exhibit selectivity for autogenous song and showed no special sensitivity to the acoustic parameters of autogenous song. These observations implicate song (motor) learning in shaping the response properties of HVc, but not field L, auditory neurons. It is proposed that HVc auditory neurons may contribute to a bird's ability to discriminate among conspecific songs by acting as an \"autogenous reference\" during perception of those songs.",

The torus semicircularis was found to consist of three main divisions: intercollicular area, torai nucleus , and preisthmic superficial area. All three appear variously subdivided. The intercollicular area is a mid\u2010mesencephalic ventral periventricular region and appears subdivided into core and shell intercollicular regions. The toral nucleus is formed by a large caudal periventricular cytoarchitectonic complex, consisting of a periventricular lamina subdivided into core and shell regions, a pericentral, diffuse external nucleus, a central nucleus subdivided into core and shell regions, a caudomedial shell nucleus, a paracentral nucleus , and a posterior hiliar nucleus , apart from other minor parcellations. The preisthmic superficial area extends superficially at the caudomedial end of the toral nucleus, reaching the paramedian dorsal brain surface just rostral to the isthmo\u2010optic nucleus. It is subdivided into core and shell regions. This previously unnoticed area is distinguished here from the intercollicular area and from the caudomedial shell and paracentral nuclei, all of which are frequently mixed in the literature under the concept \u201cintercollicular nucleus.\u201d The revised terminology and subdivision for the avian torus clarifies many chemoarchitectonic and hodological mappings reported in the literature. It also suggests new research subjects and eliminates some causes of confusion. \u00a9 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An antibody prepared against adult canary brain, 40E\u2010C, stains ventricular zone cells that send long, unbranched processes into the forebrain parenchyma. We identify these cells as radial glia. The same antibody also stains a subset of brain astroglia and reacts with nonbrain material such as mesenchyme, Sertoli cells, and the Z\u2010line of muscle. A weaker reaction is given by erythrocytes and some endothelial cells. 40E\u2010C also reacts with the radial glia of the developing rat brain but fails to show any such glia in adult rodent brain. Western blot analysis shows that this antibody recognizes vimentin, a molecule shared by all 40E\u2010C\u2010positive cell types. We believe that the presence of radial glia in the adult avian forebrain and their apparent absence in mammals is related to neurogenesis in adulthood, which occurs in birds and much less or not at all in mammals. In addition, the presence of radial glia in adult birds may also relate to other, stillhypothetical, differences in the physiology of adult avian and mammalian brains.",

    "abstract": "Bird song represents a powerful model system for many of the important problems in behavioral neurobiology, offering both easily measured sensory and motor patterns and a discrete neural effector system. Methods were developed to record the discharge of neurons in singing birds to examine the functions of nuclei in the song control pathway previously implicated anatomically. In several cases, lesions and other techniques were employed to test predictions derived from electrode recordings. Four major findings emerge from these studies. Single-unit recordings from telencephalic nucleus hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) show several classes of neurons with apparently specialized roles in song production and/or sensorimotor interaction. The nucleus interfacialis (Nlf; Nottebohm, 1980), which provides an input to HVc and is anatomically the \"highest\" nucleus in the descending motor pathway, is uniquely placed among vocal control nuclei to be a generator of timing cues for song. Consistent with the unidirectional connections between nuclei of the descending pathway, Nlf, HVc, and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA) are activated sequentially prior to sound onset. Three other nuclei with connections to or from the descending tract do not show song-related activity in the adult. Bilateral HVc recordings and peripheral disruptions of the vocal apparatus suggest that both hemispheres and syringeal halves normally make similar contributions to most if not all song syllables. The latter finding casts doubt on the analogy between neural lateralization in bird song and in human speech.",

With this aim, pigeon brain sections were processed immunohistochemi\u2010cally by using an antiserum specific for chicken choline acetyltransferase. Our results show cholinergic neurons in the pigeon basal telencephalon, the hypothalamus, the habenula, the pretectum, the midbrain tectum, the dorsal isthmus, the isthmic tegmentum, and the cranial nerve motor nuclei. Cholinergic fibers were prominent in the dorsal telencephalon, the striatum, the thalamus, the tectum, and the interpeduncular nucleus. Comparison of our results with previous studies in birds suggests some major cholinergic pathways in the avian brain and clarifies the possible origin of the cholinergic innervation of some parts of the avian brain. In addition, comparison of our results in birds with those in other vertebrate species shows that the organization of the cholinergic systems in many regions of the avian brain (such as the basal forebrain, the epithalamus, the isthmus, and the hindbrain) is much like that in reptiles and mammals. In contrast, however, birds appear largely to lack intrinsic cholinergic neurons in the dorsal (\u201cneocortex\u2010like\u201d) parts of the telencephalon. \u00a9 1994 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: We had previously reported that in vitro survival of chick embryo ciliary ganglionic neurons can be assured by the addition to the culture medium of appropriate amounts of soluble macromolecular agents termed ciliary neuronotrophic factors. Particularly rich sources of one such factor are aqueous extracts from chick embryo intraocular tissues that include the smooth and striated musculature innervated by ciliary ganglionic neurons. We report here that this eye extract also contains agents that we term ganglionic neuronotrophic factors that support the survival of 11\u2010day chick embryo sympathetic and neonatal mouse dorsal root ganglionic neurons, two traditional targets of nerve growth factor (NGF). Using a recently developed microassay procedure we found that these ganglionic activities are not inactivated by rabbit, rat, or guinea pig antisera raised against the 2.5S (beta) subunit of male mouse submaxillary NGF, rabbit antisera against 7S NGF, or quail antisera against cobra venom NGF. Both the ciliary and ganglionic activities can be quantitated simultaneously by using 24\u2010h in vitro microassays, thus permitting a direct comparison of their respective properties. Both activities were found to (a) adsorb to DE52 cellulose and coelute at a similar salt concentration, (b) focus and be recovered from isoelectric polyacrylamide gels at exactly the same pH region, (c) be heat\u2010and partially acid\u2010labile, but base\u2010stable, and (d) be inactivated by exposure to trypsin. These results suggest that the ciliary and ganglionic neuronotrophic activities are associated with the same protein.",

    "abstract": "1. The activation of current-clamped neurons in the chick nucleus magnocellularis (nMAG) by eighth nerve stimulation has been studied in a brain slice preparation using patch electrodes. Single presynaptic stimuli produced rapidly rising, suprathreshold, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with a synaptic delay of approximately 0.4 ms. Spontaneous, miniature EPSPs (mEPSPs) were evident in control extracellular solution and in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). 2. The EPSP was composed of a large, brief component that was sensitive to antagonists of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, and a smaller, slowly decaying component that was sensitive to both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA receptor antagonists. 3. Injection of depolarizing current steps revealed a strong outward rectification of the membrane conductance at potentials close to the resting potential. Consequently, neurons could fire only a single, TTX-sensitive action potential during a current step. The conductance responsible for this rectification was sensitive to 1 mM 4-aminopyridine but not to 1 mM tetraethylammonium. 4. Following the termination of depolarizing current pulses, membrane potential decayed with a half-time (t1/2) that decreased as the depolarizing current increased, reaching approximately 0.25 ms for a depolarization from rest of 20 mV. The t1/2 for the decay of EPSPs matched the membrane t1/2, indicating that the underlying synaptic conductance decays more quickly than the membrane t1/2. 5. The slow phase of the EPSP was always longer than the membrane t1/2 and increased in size with hyperpolarization. This result is consistent with the contribution of AMPA receptors to the slow, as well as fast, EPSP. 6. The safety factor for transmission with low-frequency stimuli was large, as indicated by the rise time of the EPSP, the extent to which the EPSP shunted the action potential, and the size of EPSPs after prolongation of the synaptic conductance by cyclothiazide. 7. During repetitive synaptic stimulation, the slow EPSPs summated to produce a plateau depolarization of 10\u201320 mV. The plateau potential was only partially blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists. 8. During trains of stimuli, the faster EPSPs rode atop the plateau potential and could drive action potentials at rates up to 500 Hz for short periods. Synaptic depression was evident during trains, such that EPSPs often fell below threshold after 5\u201310 stimuli at rates above 200 Hz. EPSPs could remain suprathreshold for several seconds at 50 Hz.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "In male zebra finches, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN) is necessary for the development of learned song but is not required for the production of acoustically stereotyped (crystallized) adult song. One hypothesis is that the physiological properties of LMAN neurons change over development and thus limit the ability of LMAN to affect song. To test this idea, we used in vitro intracellular recordings to characterize the intrinsic and synaptic properties of LMAN neurons in fledgling [posthatch days (PHD) 22\u201332] and juvenile zebra finches (PHD 40\u201351) when LMAN lesions disrupt normal song development, and in adults (&gt;PHD 90) when LMAN lesions are without effect. In fledglings, depolarizing currents caused LMAN projection neurons to fire bursts of action potentials because of a putative low-threshold calcium spike (LTS). In contrast, juvenile and adult LMAN projection neurons fired accommodating trains of action potentials when depolarized but did not exhibit the burst mode of firing. Electrical stimulation of thalamic afferents elicited both monosynaptic EPSPs mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors and polysynaptic IPSPs mediated by GABA A receptors from LMAN neurons at all ages studied here. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, the EPSCs (NMDA-EPSCs) consisted of fast and slow components. Unlike juvenile and adult NMDA-EPSCs, those in fledglings were dominated by the slower component. Thus, both the intrinsic and synaptic properties of LMAN neurons change markedly during early song development (PHD 22\u201340) and achieve several adult-like properties during early sensorimotor learning and well before the time when LMAN lesions no longer disrupt song development.",

Preparations appear greater than 98% pure and contain approximately 1-2 x 10(7) viable cells (20--40 mg of cell protein). Three methods were used to characterize these two culture t ypes. First, electron microscopic examination was used to identify the cells in each preparation (mixed and separated cultures of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and to assess the purity of each preparation. Second, two oligodendroglial cell markers, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.4.37) and glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) were monitored. Third, the regulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in each culture type was examined. In addition to these studies, we examined the influence of brain extract and dibutyryl cAMP on the gross morphology and ultrastructure of each preparation. These agents induced astroglial process formation without any apparent morphological effect on oligodendrocytes. Collectively, the results indicate that essentially pure cultures of astrocytes and of oligodendrocytes can be prepared and maintained. These preparations should significantly aid in efforts to examine the biochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology of these two major classes of central nervous system cells.",

The density values were compared (Mann-Whitney U-Test) with those recorded in three homolateral control structures (tractus opticus, n. rotundus, n. pretectalis principalis) and in corresponding contralateral areas and nuclei. The data showed ipsilateral projections from the visual Wulst and via the tractus septomesencephalicus upon the dorsal thalamus (n.: dorsolateralis anterior superficialis parvocellularis), ventral thalamus (n.: intercalatus, ventrolateralis, geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis--GLv), pretectum (n.: superficialis synencephali, geniculatus pretectalis, griseus tectalis, pretectalis: diffusus, pars lateralis and pars medialis, area pretectalis) as well as to the nucleus of the basal optic root, n. spiriformis medialis and optic tectum (layer 2-4, 6, 7, 12 and 13). Crossed projections were observed to pass through the supraoptic decussation and the posterior commissure, however only the contralateral n. GLv was found to be significantly labeled. Interspecies variations in the organization of descending visual Wulst projections, related to the terminal distribution and relative size of the crossed components may be linked to differences in the degree of overlap of the binocular fields.

Quantitation of the motions of migrating neurons revealed a saltatory pattern of advance along the glial fiber. Periods of cell soma movement at the rate of 56 +/- 26 micron/hr along the glial fiber are punctuated by periods during which the cell soma slows to a complete stop. The overall rate of migration is 33 +/- 20 micron/hr. The growing tip of the leading process rapidly extends and retracts, resulting in a net advance along the glial fiber. However, the periods of the extension and retraction of the leading process growing tip are not synchronized with the motions of the cell soma.",

    "title": "Revised nomenclature for avian telencephalon and some related brainstem nuclei",
    "abstract": "Abstract The standard nomenclature that has been used for many telencephalic and related brainstem structures in birds is based on flawed assumptions of homology to mammals. In particular, the outdated terminology implies that most of the avian telencephalon is a hypertrophied basal ganglia, when it is now clear that most of the avian telencephalon is neurochemically, hodologically, and functionally comparable to the mammalian neocortex, claustrum, and pallial amygdala (all of which derive from the pallial sector of the developing telencephalon). Recognizing that this promotes misunderstanding of the functional organization of avian brains and their evolutionary relationship to mammalian brains, avian brain specialists began discussions to rectify this problem, culminating in the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum held at Duke University in July 2002, which approved a new terminology for avian telencephalon and some allied brainstem cell groups. Details of this new terminology are presented here, as is a rationale for each name change and evidence for any homologies implied by the new names. Revisions for the brainstem focused on vocal control, catecholaminergic, cholinergic, and basal ganglia\u2010related nuclei. For example, the Forum recognized that the hypoglossal nucleus had been incorrectly identified as the nucleus intermedius in the Karten and Hodos ( 1967 ) pigeon brain atlas, and what was identified as the hypoglossal nucleus in that atlas should instead be called the supraspinal nucleus. The locus ceruleus of this and other avian atlases was noted to consist of a caudal noradrenergic part homologous to the mammalian locus coeruleus and a rostral region corresponding to the mammalian A8 dopaminergic cell group. The midbrain dopaminergic cell group in birds known as the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta was recognized as homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars compacta and was renamed accordingly; a group of \u03b3\u2010aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons at the lateral edge of this region was identified as homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars reticulata and was also renamed accordingly. A field of cholinergic neurons in the rostral avian hindbrain was named the nucleus pedunculopontinus tegmenti, whereas the anterior nucleus of the ansa lenticularis in the avian diencephalon was renamed the subthalamic nucleus, both for their evident mammalian homologues. For the basal (i.e., subpallial) telencephalon, the actual parts of the basal ganglia were given names reflecting their now evident homologues. For example, the lobus parolfactorius and paleostriatum augmentatum were acknowledged to make up the dorsal subdivision of the striatal part of the basal ganglia and were renamed as the medial and lateral striatum. The paleostriatum primitivum was recognized as homologous to the mammalian globus pallidus and renamed as such. Additionally, the rostroventral part of what was called the lobus parolfactorius was acknowledged as comparable to the mammalian nucleus accumbens, which, together with the olfactory tubercle, was noted to be part of the ventral striatum in birds. A ventral pallidum, a basal cholinergic cell group, and medial and lateral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis were also recognized. The dorsal (i.e., pallial) telencephalic regions that had been erroneously named to reflect presumed homology to striatal parts of mammalian basal ganglia were renamed as part of the pallium, using prefixes that retain most established abbreviations, to maintain continuity with the outdated nomenclature. We concluded, however, that one\u2010to\u2010one (i.e., discrete) homologies with mammals are still uncertain for most of the telencephalic pallium in birds and thus the new pallial terminology is largely devoid of assumptions of one\u2010to\u2010one homologies with mammals. The sectors of the hyperstriatum composing the Wulst (i.e., the hyperstriatum accessorium intermedium, and dorsale), the hyperstriatum ventrale, the neostriatum, and the archistriatum have been renamed (respectively) the hyperpallium (hypertrophied pallium), the mesopallium (middle pallium), the nidopallium (nest pallium), and the arcopallium (arched pallium). The posterior part of the archistriatum has been renamed the posterior pallial amygdala, the nucleus taeniae recognized as part of the avian amygdala, and a region inferior to the posterior paleostriatum primitivum included as a subpallial part of the avian amygdala. The names of some of the laminae and fiber tracts were also changed to reflect current understanding of the location of pallial and subpallial sectors of the avian telencephalon. Notably, the lamina medularis dorsalis has been renamed the pallial\u2010subpallial lamina. We urge all to use this new terminology, because we believe it will promote better communication among neuroscientists. Further information is available at http://avianbrain.org . J. Comp.

    "abstract": "Abstract Birds have well\u2010developed basal ganglia within the telencephalon, including a striatum consisting of the medially located lobus parolfactorius (LPO) and the laterally located paleostriatum augmentatum (PA), Relatively little is known, however, about the extent and organization of the telencephalic \u201ccortical\u201d input to the avian basal ganglia (i. e., the avian \u201ccorticostriatal\u201d projection system). Using retrograde and anterograde neuroanatomical pathway tracers to address this issue, we found that a large continuous expanse of the outer pallium projects to the striatum of the basal ganglia in pigeons. This expanse includes the Wulst and archistriatum as well as the entire outer rind of the pallium intervening between Wulst and archistriatum, termed by us the pallium externum (PE). In addition, the caudolateral neostriatum (NCL), pyriform cortex, and hippocampal complex also give rise to striatal projections in pigeon. A restricted number of these pallial regions (such as the \u201climbic\u201d NCL, pyriform cortex, and ventral/caudal parts of the archistriatum) project to such ventral striatal structures as the olfactory tubercle (TO), nucleus accumbens (Ac), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Such \u201climbic\u201d pallial areas also project to medialmost LPO and lateralmost PA, while the hyperstriatum accessorium portion of the Wulst, the PE, and the dorsal parts of the archistriatum were found to project primarily to the remainder of LPO (the lateral two\u2010thirds) and PA (the medial four\u2010fifths). The available evidence indicates that the diverse pallial regions projecting to the striatum in birds, as in mammals, are parts of higher order sensory or motor systems. The extensive corticostriatal system in both birds and mammals appears to include two types of pallial neurons: (1) those that project to both striatum and brainstem (i. e., those in the Wulst and the archistriatum) and (2) those that project to striatum but not to brainstem (i. e., those in the PE). The lack of extensive corticostriatal projections from either type of neuron in anamniotes suggests that the anamniote\u2010amniote evolutionary transition was marked by the emergence of the corticostriatal projection system as a prominent source of sensory and motor information for the striatum, possibly facilitating the role of the basal ganglia in movement control. \u00a9 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

In contrast, although presynaptic or \u201canterograde\u201d influences on the survival of developing neurons have been recognized for some time, the mechanisms by which afferent input regulates the survival of postsynaptic cells have received considerably less attention. In the forebrain network for learned vocal behavior in zebra finches, lesions of a cortical region for song control, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (lMAN), remove presynaptic input to a motor-cortical song region, the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), and cause massive RA neuron death in young birds that are entering the sensitive period for song learning. Here we report that lesions of lMAN followed by infusions of neurotrophins directly into RA completely suppress neuronal apoptosis in RA. Moreover, we show that lMAN neurons are able to transport neurotrophins in the anterograde direction to RA, that neurotrophin-like immunoreactivity is present in cells in lMAN and RA, and that neurotrophin receptor-like immunoreactivity is present in RA. Expression of neurotrophins in lMAN and RA suggests that lMAN presynaptic input could regulate RA neuron survival by synthesizing, transporting, and releasing neurotrophins anterogradely or by regulating the auto/paracrine release of neurotrophins within RA, or perhaps by both. These data provide the first in vivo demonstration that neurotrophins can prevent the death of deafferented cortical neurons, and they raise the possibility that nonretrograde signaling by neurotrophins may be a common means of promoting neuronal survival in the vertebrate telencephalon. Anterograde and auto/paracrine neurotrophin signaling, along with the more established view that neurotrophins regulate neuron survival via retrograde mechanisms, suggests multidirectional neurotrophin signaling in the vertebrate telencephalon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: On polyornithine (PORN) substrata dissociated 8\u2010day chick embryo ciliary ganglionic neurons will survive if the culture medium is supplemented with Ciliary Neuronotrophic Factor. However, neuritic growth will not occur unless the substratum is derivatized with a PORN\u2010bindable Neurite Promoting Factor (PNPF). In this preliminary study we report that soluble PNPF can be (1) assayed by a convenient in vitro system; (2) obtained in relatively large amounts from serum\u2010free media conditioned over RN22 Schwannoma cultures; (3) concentrated by using Amicon XM100 ultrafiltration; and (4) separated from nearly all of the non\u2010active protein by using ion\u2010exchange chromatography. The partially purified PNPF can be concentrated using XM100 and is heat\u2010 and protease\u2010sensitive. In the course of these fractionation studies we observed in some cases a concentration\u2010dependent interference with the expression of PNPF activity in the bioassay; we propose graphical methods to permit the simultaneous determination of PNPF and the extent of such interference. Different treatments that affected the interference property did not always affect PNPF activity in a reciprocal manner, leaving open the possibility that the interference with PNPF activity results from reversible alteration of the PNPF molecule, or that there exists a separate interfering agent.",

    "title": "Acoustic parameters underlying the responses of song-specific neurons in the white-crowned sparrow",
    "abstract": "Songbirds such as the white-crowned sparrow memorize the song of conspecific adults during a critical period early in life and later in life develop song by utilizing auditory feedback. Neurons in one of the telencephalic nuclei controlling song have recently been shown to respond to acoustic stimuli. I investigated the auditory response properties of units in this nucleus using a technique that permitted great flexibility in manipulating complex stimuli such as song. A few of the units exhibited considerable selectivity for the individual's own song. In wild-caught birds, song-specific units exhibited intradialect selectivity. In those birds that sang abnormal songs due to laboratory manipulation of song exposure during the critical period for song learning, units were selective for the abnormal songs. By systematic modification of a song, and by construction of complex synthetic sounds mimicking song, the acoustic parameters responsible for the response selectivity were identified. Song-specific units responded to sequences of two song parts but not to the parts in isolation. Modification of the frequencies of either part of the sequence, or increasing the interval between the parts, varied the strength of the response. Thus, temporal as well as spectral parameters were important for the response. When sequences of synthetic sounds mimicking song were effective in evoking an excitatory response, the response was sensitive to the aforementioned manipulations. Wih these techniques it was possible to elucidate the acoustic parameters required to excite song-specific units. All songs of the repertoire eliciting a strong excitatory response contained the appropriate parameters, which were missing from all weakly effective, ineffective, or inhibitory songs.",

    "title": "A circuit for coding interaural time differences in the chick brainstem",
    "abstract": "Third-order auditory neurons in the avian nucleus laminaris (NL) are the first to receive binaural input. In the chick, NL consists of a monolayer of neurons with polarized dendritic arbors oriented dorsally and ventrally. Afferents from second-order neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis (NM) innervate the dorsal dendrites of NL neurons, distributing processes of approximately equal length to NL neurons along an isofrequency band (roughly caudomedial to rostrolateral). Afferents from the contralateral NM innervate the ventral dendrites of NL neurons, distributing collateral branches sequentially as they proceed from caudomedial to rostrolateral along the isofrequency band of neurons. This innervation pattern could be the basis of a \"delay line\" circuit, as postulated in models of neural networks mediating sound localization. We examined this circuit by analyzing evoked field potentials using a brain slice preparation containing both NL and NM. The results were consistent with the previous anatomical findings. When the ipsilateral auditory nerve or ipsilateral NM was stimulated, there was no consistent variation in the latency of postsynaptic field potentials across the medial-to-lateral extent of NL. In contrast, when the contralateral NM or NM axons in the crossed dorsal cochlear tract were stimulated, a linear increase in the latency of postsynaptic potentials was observed from medial to lateral positions in NL. When stimulation amplitudes for both the ipsilateral and contralateral inputs were adjusted so as to produce little or no postsynaptic field potential, simultaneous bilateral stimulation evoked a pronounced response. Thus, NL neurons can act as \"coincidence detectors.\" The amplitude of the postsynaptic response was dependent on the relative timing of stimulation of the two inputs. The optimal time difference changed systematically across the medial-to-lateral extent of NL. This system of delay lines and coincidence detectors could provide a mechanism for converting interaural time differences into a \"place map\" within NL.",
