      "abstract": "To study the selectivity of neurotrophic actions in the brain, we analyzed the actions of several known growth factors on septal cholinergic, pontine cholinergic, and mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in culture. Similar to nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulated choline acetyltransferase activity in septal cultures. In contrast to NGF, bFGF also enhanced dopamine uptake in mesencephalic cultures and stimulated cell proliferation in all 3 culture types. Insulin and the insulin-like growth factors I and II stimulated transmitter-specific differentiation and cell proliferation in all culture types. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) produced a small increase in dopamine uptake by mesencephalic cells and stimulated cell proliferation in all culture types. In septal cultures, bFGF was most effective when given at early culture times, NGF at later times. The stimulatory actions of bFGF and insulin did not require the presence of glial cells and were not mediated by NGF. In mesencephalic cultures, the stimulation of dopamine uptake by bFGF and EGF was dependent on glial proliferation. The results suggest different degrees of selectivity of the neurotrophic molecules. NGF and, very similarly, bFGF seem to influence septal cholinergic neurons directly and rather selectively, whereas the neurotrophic actions of insulin and the insulin-like growth factors appear to be more general.",

      "abstract": "Recombinant human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (rhBDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (rhNT-3), two recently cloned molecules closely related to nerve growth factor (NGF), were produced from human cDNA expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. The recombinant proteins were tested in cultures of dissociated fetal rat brain cells containing basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. rhBDNF stimulated the differentiation of the cholinergic neurons, similar to NGF, which is well established as a neurotrophic factor for these cells. However, rhBDNF was particularly effective during the first few days in vitro, whereas the stimulatory action of rhNGF was more pronounced later in the development of the cultures. This finding indicates the existence of different time periods of responsiveness of the cholinergic neurons to BDNF and NGF. To assess the selectivity of the effect of rhBDNF on cholinergic neurons, its actions were tested in cultures of ventral mesencephalon containing dopaminergic cells. In contrast to NGF, which does not affect central dopaminergic neurons, rhBDNF increased dopamine uptake activity. The findings suggest that BDNF stimulates survival or differentiation of other cells besides the cholinergic neurons.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide and a huge perpetrator in adult disability. This pilot clinical study investigates the possible benefits of transplanting multiple cells in chronic stroke. A total of 10 consecutive stroke patients were treated by combination cell transplantation on the basis of an intraparenchymal approach from November 2003 to April 2011. There were six males and four females. Their age ranged from 42 to 87 years, and the course of disease varied from 6 months to 20 years. Six patients suffered cerebral infarction, and four patients suffered a brain hemorrhage. The olfactory ensheathing cells, neural progenitor cells, umbilical cord mesenchymal cells, and Schwann cells were injected through selected routes including intracranial parenchymal implantation, intrathecal implantation, and intravenous administration, respectively. The clinical neurological function was assessed carefully and independently before treatment and during a long-term follow-up using the Clinic Neurologic Impairment Scale and the Barthel index. All patients were followed up successfully from 6 months to 2 years after cell transplantation. Every subject achieved neurological function amelioration including improved speech, muscle strength, muscular tension, balance, pain, and breathing; most patients had an increased Barthel index score and Clinic Neurologic Impairment Scale score. These preliminary results demonstrate the novel strategy of combined multiple cell therapy based on intraparenchymal delivery: it appears to be relatively clinically safe and at least initially beneficial for chronic stroke patients.

      "abstract": "Abstract We investigated the influence of different subcortical structures on the survival of specific populations of occipital cortex neurons developing in vitro. Explants of embryonic day 14–15 (E14–15) rat cortex were cultured for 5 days with explants of either diencephalon or optic tectum or another occipital cortex explant. Stereological analysis of the explants revealed that after 5 days in vitro (5 DIV) all the cortical explants contained equal proportions of healthy neurons, glia, neuropil, and degenerating profiles, regardless of the culturing conditions. In order to determine if different neuronal populations survived preferentially in the cortical explants as a result of the presence of potential target or afferent structures, we used HRP filling and 3 H‐thymidine labeling techniques. Specific differences in the morphology of the cells and their time of origin are found in the cortical explants. In the cortical explants cocultured with diencephalon (Cx+D) the cortical cells that survive tend to be round with small cross‐sectional areas and have few neurites. These cells are generated late in the culturing period. The surviving cortical neurons in the cortex plus tectum (Cx + T) cultures are larger‐many with a pyramidal‐shaped soma and several neurites. These cells are generated earlier in vitro . The cortex cultured with other cortex (Cx+Cx) gives values intermediate to the Cx+D and Cx+T cultures. The results of these experiments suggest that there are diffusible trophic factors that arise from subcortical structures that selectively support the survival of neuron populations in the developing neocortex.",

      "abstract": "Little is known about the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the response to neurotrophins and other neurotrophic factors in neurons, beyond the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the neurotrophin receptors belonging to the trk family. We have previously shown that the introduction of the oncogene product ras p21 into the cytoplasm of chick embryonic neurons can reproduce the survival and neurite-outgrowth promoting effects of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). To assess the potential signal-transducing role of endogenous ras p21, we introduced function-blocking anti-ras antibodies or their Fab fragments into cultured chick embryonic neurons. The BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth in E12 nodose ganglion neurons was reduced to below control levels, and the NGF-induced survival of E9 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was inhibited in a specific and dose-dependent fashion. Both effects could be reversed by saturating the epitope-binding sites with biologically inactive ras p21 before microinjection. Surprisingly, ras p21 did not promote the survival of NGF-dependent E12 chick sympathetic neurons, and the NGF-induced survival in these cells was not inhibited by the Fab-fragments. The survival effect of CNTF on ras-responsive ciliary neurons could not be blocked by anti-ras Fab fragments. These results indicate an involvement of ras p21 in the signal transduction of neurotrophic factors in sensory, but not sympathetic or ciliary neurons, pointing to the existence of different signaling pathways not only in CNTF-responsive, but also in neurotrophin-responsive neuronal populations.",

      "paperId": "W1765527890",
      "abstract": "Neurotrophic support is generally believed to result from a direct action of growth factors on developing neurons. However, there is increasing evidence that growth factors can indirectly affect neuronal development by glial-mediated processes. To investigate a possible role of glia in mediating neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic neurons, four purified growth factors were screened for dual effects on the survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and on the proliferation of mesencephalic glial cells in vitro. Dissociated embryonic day 14.5 rat mesencephalon was grown at low cell density without serum, conditions under which both glial growth and neuronal survival are not optimal. Treatment of these cultures with acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased the number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) neurons by 90- 110% [corrected] at 8 d in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of these factors were not additive. High-affinity dopamine uptake was increased by bFGF, but not by aFGF. Length of TH-IR neurites was not affected by either aFGF or bFGF. Both growth factors induced proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes as demonstrated by autoradiographic labeling with 3H-thymidine combined with immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-1 had no effect on the survival or differentiation of dopaminergic neurons or the proliferation of mesencephalic astrocytes. Inhibition of glial proliferation abolished the neurotrophic effects exerted by aFGF or bFGF on dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, conditioned medium derived from mesencephalic glial cultures replated in the virtual absence of neurons also contained neurotrophic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "paperId": "W2045776001",
      "abstract": "Neurons in the rat medial septum (MS) and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB) undergo a rapid and severe cell death after transection of their dorsal projection to the hippocampus by aspiration of the ipsilateral fimbria fornix and supracallosal striae. By 2 weeks posttransection, the extent of neuronal loss was 50% of the total neurons and 70% of the cholinergic neurons in the MS and 30% of the total neurons and 40% of the cholinergic neurons in the VDB. We hypothesized that (i) the death was due to the loss of a hippocampus-derived neuronotrophic factor, and (ii) exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) might provide trophic support to the MS/VDB cholinergic neurons, in light of recent reports that the septal diagonal band cholinergic neurons are responsive to NGF and that NGF is present and produced in the hippocampus. In the present study, we attempted to prevent the transection-induced neuronal death by continuous infusion of exogenous 7S NGF (1 microgram/wk) through an intraventricular cannula device. We report here that NGF treatment significantly reduces both the total neuronal and cholinergic neuronal death found 2 weeks after fimbria fornix transection; there was a sparing of 50% of the neurons in the MS and essentially 100% of those in the VDB that otherwise would have died. We conclude that NGF also has a protective effect on noncholinergic neurons since calculations indicate that 80% of the NGF-affected neurons are noncholinergic.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Both blood vessels and nerves are guided to their target. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A is a key signal in the induction of vessel growth (a process termed angiogenesis). Though initial studies, now a decade ago, indicated that VEGF is an endothelial cell‐specific factor, more recent findings revealed that VEGF also has direct effects on neural cells. Genetic studies showed that mice with reduced VEGF levels develop adult‐onset motor neuron degeneration, reminiscent of the human neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additional genetic studies confirmed that VEGF is a modifier of motor neuron degeneration in humans and in SOD1 G93A mice—a model of ALS. Reduced VEGF levels may promote motor neuron degeneration by limiting neural tissue perfusion and VEGF‐dependent neuroprotection. VEGF also affects neuron death after acute spinal cord or cerebral ischemia, and has also been implicated in other neurological disorders such as diabetic and ischemic neuropathy, nerve regeneration, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. These findings have raised growing interest in assessing the therapeutic potential of VEGF for neurodegenerative disorders. BioEssays 26:943–954, 2004. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "paperId": "W2062021966",
      "abstract": "Abstract: In this report, we have examined the structure, regulation, and function of insulin receptors in cultured neurons from fetal chicken brain. The apparent molecular weight of the α‐subunit of neuronal insulin receptors, analyzed by photoaffinity labeling and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, was 115,000. The number of insulin receptors in the cultures increased from day 2 to day 4 during a period of extensive process formation. After 5 days in culture, there were approximately 40,000 high‐affinity insulin receptors per neuron. When neurons were photoaffinity labeled at 16°C and then warmed to 37°C for 30 min, approximately 40% of the cell‐surface receptors were recovered in the intracellular, trypsin‐insensitive pool. Chronic exposure of neurons to insulin (100 ng/ml) resulted in a time‐dependent loss of neuronal insulin receptors with a maximal decrease of 50% after 24 h. Insulin had no effect on glucose transport, glucose oxidation, or glycogen synthase activity in neurons. On the other hand, insulin supported the growth and differentiation of a fraction of neurons isolated from chick forebrain. We conclude that (1) cultured neurons from fetal chicken brain express the same subtype of insulin receptor previously identified in adult rat and human brain, (2) the neuronal subtype of insulin receptor undergoes internalization and down‐regulation in response to insulin, and (3) neuronal insulin receptors do not acutely regulate glucose metabolism but mediate growth in neurons.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac arrest-induced global cerebral ischemia injury (CA-GCII) usually leads to a poor neurological outcome without an effective treatment. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) may provide a potential cell-based therapy against neurologic disorders through induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To optimize the neuroprotective efficacy of BMMSCs further, in this study we have derived BMMSCs, which co-overexpress both BDNF and VEGF, and tested them for the treatment of CA-GCII in a rat model. Lentiviruses that express rat BDNF exon IV or VEGF-A were created using the bicistronic shuttle vectors of pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 and pLVX-IRES-tdTomato, respectively. BMMSCs that were co-transduced with the engineered lentiviruses with co-overexpression of both BDNF and VEGF along with corresponding fluorescent protein reporters were injected via jugular vein of rats that just recovered from a cardiac arrest. Animals were then scored for neurofunctional deficits and examined for brain pathology and gene expression relevant to the engraftment seven days after the treatments. We demonstrate that anchorage of lentiviral vector-transduced BMMSCs, which co-overexpressed both BDNF and VEGF in the hippocampus and temporal cortex along with significantly ameliorated brain pathology and improved neurofunctional performance in CA-GCII rats after transplantation. These findings provide a proof of concept for the further validation of engineered BMMSCs for the treatment of CA-GCII patients in clinical practice in the future.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Valproic acid (VPA) is a first‐line antiseizure medication (ASM) that is highly efficacious for treating generalized and focal epilepsy disorders. Unfortunately, due to its strong association with teratogenic effects culminating in fetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD), which may include neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficits, the drug has become highly regulated/restricted for women of childbearing potential. This includes those who have been shown to respond well to the drug and respond poorly to alternative ASMs. Concurrently, VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic mechanisms have been studied in vitro, and continued research may aid in providing depth to our understanding so that superior evidence‐based care plans and novel drug designs can be made for patients with epilepsy disorders. This scoping review systematically assesses what in vitro studies have discovered regarding VPA's effects on neural cells and the proposed cellular neurotoxic mechanisms. Neurotoxicity studies have captured the cytotoxic, dysmorphological, genetic, and epigenetic effects in murine and human primary, immortalized, and stem cells in vitro. This includes extensive identification of many genes and gene pathways associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, a hallmark of FVSD. Although published studies have illuminated much about VPA's neurotoxic, teratogenic effects, a lack of standardization in testing methodologies renders making direct comparisons between the results of different studies challenging. Nevertheless, the recent use of human stem cell‐based models provides a richer understanding of what cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic effects are caused by VPA exposure. Future in vitro studies may improve their clinical translatability by administering clinically relevant concentrations of VPA to human stem cell‐derived neural cells and fostering a better understanding of VPA's neural cell type‐specific and epigenetic effects. In vitro VPA neurotoxicity studies on neurodevelopment show a clear potential to provide data that may help construct superior personalized evidence‐based treatment plans and novel drug designs for women of childbearing potential with epilepsy disorders.",

      "paperId": "W2165609315",
      "abstract": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supports the survival of neurons from many regions of the E18 fetal rat brain. Survival was significantly increased for neurons derived from the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), frontal cortex, parietal cortex (PC), occipital cortex, striatum, septum, and thalamus, but not from the subiculum (Sb). The proportion of neurons rescued by bFGF varied among brain regions, suggesting the existence of subpopulations of responsive neurons. Like hippocampal neurons, neurons from the EC and PC required about 1 pM bFGF (10-20 pg/ml) for half-maximal response; striatal neurons, in contrast, required about 3 pM bFGF. Neurite outgrowth after 24 hr exposure was significantly increased for neurons from the hippocampus, EC, and PC, while striatal neurons had only a marginal response. Although bFGF stimulated some astrocytic proliferation in the cultures, glial contamination was maintained at 2% or less. Acidic FGF (aFGF) supported smaller numbers of neurons from each region, although it significantly increased survival of neurons from hippocampus, EC, PC, striatum, and Sb. The concentration required for half-maximal survival was around 100-300 pM (2-5 ng/ml). It appears that bFGF and aFGF are potent trophic factors for many populations of CNS neurons and could potentially play a significant role in nervous system development.",

      "abstract": "Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been found to increase neuronal survival and neurite extension in a highly purified population of fetal rat hippocampal neurons under well-defined serum-free cell culture conditions. In the presence of FGF, neuronal survival after 7 days in culture on a simple plastic substrate is increased 4-fold, to 54% of the initial population. Survival is increased 2-fold to 40% on polyornithine-laminin. When FGF was bound to plastic or heparin substrates, neurite outgrowth was significantly increased to lengths comparable to those seen with laminin; however, FGF produced no further increase in neurite outgrowth on laminin. Half-maximal survival was observed at FGF concentrations of about 15 pg/ml (1 pM); half-maximal process outgrowth occurred at about 375 pg/ml (20 pM). The responsive cells were identified as neurons by their labeling with tetanus toxin and by antibodies to neurofilaments and to the neuron-specific enolase. Astrocytes, identified by the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein, constituted about 10% of cells present at 1 week both in the presence and in the absence of FGF.

The morphology biochemistry, and in vitro development of this and other spinal cord cell fractions isolated by the outlined procedure were investigated. Spinal cords, dissected from 6-day chick or 12-day rat embryos, were dissociated with trypsin and applied to iso-osmotic metrizamide density gradients. After brief centrifugation, biochemical analysis revealed that cholinergic cells migrated to lower densities than other spinal cord cells. The use of discontinuous density gradients allowed rapid and simple isolation of three fractions of viable cells (designated F-1 to F-3, lowest to highest density). Characterization of chicken and rat embryo cell fractions gave similar results. The cells in Fraction 1 were large with prominent nuclei and nucleoli, while those in F-2 and F-3 were distinctly smaller. Fraction 1 was highly enriched for cholinergic cells. The CAT specific activity (CAT/cell) was increased 400% in Fraction 1 compared to unfractionated cells, while CAT specific activity in F-2 and F-3 was reduced to 25% and less than 4% that of unfractionated cells, respectively. The recovery of cholinergic cells using this procedure was much better than with other published procedures; greater than half the spinal cord CAT activity was routinely recovered in the enriched fraction. The cholinergic-enriched cells (F-1) were unique in their in vitro growth characteristics. All fractions had neuronal cells, while non-neuronal cells were distributed primarily in F-3, fewer in F-2, and were essentially absent from F-1. Neurons in F-2 and F-3 remained viable under a variety of conditions, most of which were not supportive of F-1 cell survival. The cholinergic-enriched F-1 cells survived and developed only in the presence of muscle cells or in muscle-conditioned medium on highly adhesive substrata. Large, multipolar neurons predominated under these conditions. The method described provides a means of characterizing the factors involved in the development of distinct populations of cells from the embryonic spinal cord.",

The IATA were developed to assess the applicability of the DNT in vitro testing battery (IVB), designed to explore fundamental neurodevelopmental processes, in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides. For this purpose, an evidence-based-approach methodology was applied: 1) systematic literature review and critical appraisal of all the evidence i.e. human observational studies, in vivo data from rodent models and new approach methodologies (NAMs, i.e. in vitro studies including high-throughput testing from IVB and zebrafish studies from the literature) for both case studies; 2) a quantitative uncertainty analysis of all the evidence using expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) and a probabilistic approach; 3) integration of all the evidence using the AOP conceptual framework. This stepwise approach resulted in the postulation of an evidence-based AOP network for one of the case studies. A probabilistic quantification of the weight of evidence (WoE) using Bayesian network analysis allowed the assessment and the quantification of the uncertainty in the postulated AOP. The approach taken allowed conclusions to be drawn with an acceptable level of certainty in DNT hazard identification and characterisation of deltamethrin and that flufenacet is not a developmental neurotoxicant, supporting the relevance of the mechanistic understanding. The case studies show the applicability of the DNT-IVB for hazard identification and characterisation and illustrate the usefulness of an AOP-informed IATA for regulatory decision making. The overall activity led to improved interpretation of human data by providing a plausible mechanistic link to adverse outcomes, which would support their contextualisation in the risk assessment process. This Scientific Opinion allows the PPR Panel to draft several recommendations for the implementation of the AOP-informed IATA methodology and of the DNT-IVB in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides.",

      "paperId": "W2111915910",
      "abstract": "Conditioned media from glial cell cultures contain low molecular weight agents which can support survival of CNS neurons in the absence of recognized protein neuronotrophic factors. A similar support is provided to CNS neurons by selected basal media, and pyruvate is the critical medium constituent responsible for their trophic competence. Eagle's basal medium, which contains no pyruvate, acquires pyruvate when conditioned over astroglial cell cultures. Enzymatic degradation of the pyruvate in the astroglia-conditioned medium leads to corresponding losses in its low molecular weight trophic activity for CNS neurons. Quantitative correlations between pyruvate content and CNS trophic activity demonstrate that pyruvate is the main trophic ingredient of the glia-conditioned medium, and other low molecular weight substances, acquired during conditioning, reduce the pyruvate concentration required for its trophic effect. The \"pyruvate-sparing\" substances, as yet unidentified, are not the serine and Fe3+ which have pyruvate-sparing competence for peripheral, ciliary ganglionic neurons. These findings, together with previous observations, propose that prenatal neurons fail to generate or retain endogenous pyruvate at the levels for their survival-sustaining activities.",

      "paperId": "W1972897337",
      "abstract": "Abstract Considerable variations in both neuritic and non‐neuronal cell outgrowths of ganglionic expiant cultures are imposed when different substrata and medium supplements are used. Therefore, a neuritic response to exogenous agents such as gangliosides may be better, or exclusively revealed under selected combinations of medium and substratum. We have surveyed a number of different ganglia for their ability to display a neuritic response to ganglioside GM1 and the culture conditions under which such a display may take place. GM1 can recognizably promote neurite extension from embryonic day 8 chick dorsal root ganglia, day 11 sympathetic ganglia, and day 8 ciliary ganglia. Demonstration of such effects, however, requires an appropriate balance between promoting and inhibiting influences by other extrinsic influences (culture substrata, neuronotrophic factors, serum inhibitors) thereby allowing for improvement by the ganglioside. Different ganglia require different combinations of those influences. Ciliary ganglia, for example, will show a GM1 response on a polyornithine substratum in medium supplemented with the chick eye Ciliary Neuronotrophic Factor and 1% fetal calf serum, but not with 10% serum or no serum. The effective concentration range for GM1 is in accord with previously reported serum binding data. These, and other data are consistent with an action of GM1 in executing a neurite program, rather than an imposition of the program itself.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The zebrafish embryo is a useful small model for investigating vertebrate development because of its transparency, low cost, transgenic and morpholino capabilities, conservation of cell signaling, and concordance with mammalian developmental phenotypes. From these advantages, the zebrafish embryo has been considered as an alternative model for traditional in vivo developmental toxicity screening. The use of this organism in conjunction with traditional in vivo developmental toxicity testing has the potential to reduce cost and increase throughput of testing the chemical universe, prioritize chemicals for targeted toxicity testing, generate predictive models of developmental toxicants, and elucidate mechanisms and adverse outcome pathways for abnormal development. This review gives an overview of the zebrafish embryo for pre dictive toxicology and 21st century toxicity testing. Developmental eye defects were selected as an example to evaluate data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ToxCast program comparing responses in zebrafish embryos with those from pregnant rats and rabbits for a subset of 24 environmental chemicals across &gt;600 in vitro assay targets. Cross‐species comparisons implied a common basis for biological pathways associated with neuronal defects, extracellular matrix remodeling, and mitotic arrest.

      "abstract": "Systemic toxicity testing forms the cornerstone for the safety evaluation of substances. Pressures to move from traditional animal models to novel technologies arise from various concerns, including: the need to evaluate large numbers of previously untested chemicals and new products (such as nanoparticles or cell therapies), the limited predictivity of traditional tests for human health effects, duration and costs of current approaches, and animal welfare considerations. The latter holds especially true in the context of the scheduled 2013 marketing ban on cosmetic ingredients tested for systemic toxicity. Based on a major analysis of the status of alternative methods (Adler et al., 2011) and its independent review (Hartung et al., 2011), the present report proposes a roadmap for how to overcome the acknowledged scientific gaps for the full replacement of systemic toxicity testing using animals. Five whitepapers were commissioned addressing toxicokinetics, skin sensitization, repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity testing. An expert workshop of 35 participants from Europe and the US discussed and refined these whitepapers, which were subsequently compiled to form the present report. By prioritizing the many options to move the field forward, the expert group hopes to advance regulatory science.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases resulting from the progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons contribute to different paralysis degrees and loss of cognition and sensation. The lack of successful curative therapies for neurodegenerative disorders leads to a considerable burden on society and a high economic impact. Over the past 20 years, regenerative cell therapy, also known as stem cell therapy, has provided an excellent opportunity to investigate potentially powerful innovative strategies for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This is due to stem cells’ capability to repair injured neuronal tissue by replacing the damaged or lost cells with differentiated cells, providing a conducive environment that is in favor of regeneration, or protecting the existing healthy neurons and glial cells from further damage. Thus, in this review, the various types of stem cells, the current knowledge of stem-cell-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, and the recent advances in this field are summarized. Indeed, a better understanding and further studies of stem cell technologies cause progress into realistic and efficacious treatments of neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "paperId": "W1500403088",
      "abstract": "Neuritic regression and cell death (neurodegeneration) are common features of both normal nervous system development and neurodegenerative disorders. Growth factors and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters have been suggested independently to play roles in neurodegenerative processes. The present study investigated the combined effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and glutamate on the development and degeneration of cultured hippocampal neurons. Consistent with previous data, we found that FGF, but not NGF, promoted neuronal survival and dendritic outgrowth. In contrast, a low level of glutamate (50 microM) caused a reduction in dendritic outgrowth, and high levels (100 microM-1 mM) reduced neuronal survival in a dose-dependent manner. When cultures were maintained in the presence of FGF, there was a striking reduction in neuronal death normally caused by 100-500 microM glutamate. FGF raised the threshold for glutamate neurotoxicity. FGF also antagonized the outgrowth-inhibiting actions of glutamate. Measurements of intracellular calcium levels with fura-2 demonstrated a direct relationship between glutamate-induced rises in intracellular calcium and neurodegeneration. FGF reduced the glutamate-induced increases in intracellular calcium levels. However, when cultures were pretreated with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, FGF did not prevent glutamate-induced increases in intracellular calcium or neurodegeneration. Taken together, these results suggest that (1) interactions between growth factors and neurotransmitters may be important in brain development; (2) imbalances in these systems may lead to neurodegeneration; and (3) cellular calcium-regulating systems may be a common focus of growth factor and neurotransmitter actions.",

      "abstract": "The effect of fibrin matrix micromorphology on neurite growth was investigated by measuring the length of neurites growing in three-dimensional fibrin gels with well characterized micromorphologies. Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from 7-day chick embryos were entrapped and cultured in gels made from varying concentrations of fibrinogen (5–15 mg/mL) or calcium (2–10 mM). The length of growing neurites was measured with light videomicroscopy, and the number and diameter of fibrin fiber bundles were measured from scanning electron micrographs. An increase in fibrinogen concentration caused a decrease in the average fiber bundle thickness, an increase in the number of fiber bundles, and a marked decrease in neurite length. Gels made with different calcium concentrations had a similar range of variation in fibrin fiber bundle number or diameter, but these variations had little effect on neurite and associated nonneuronal cell outgrowth. These results provide insights into the process of neurite advance within fibrin and may be useful in the design of fibrin-based materials used for peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, this study provides the first detailed experimental data on the micromorphology of fibrin matrices made from more than 5 mg/mL of fibrinogen and indicates that existing kinetic models of fibrin polymerization do not accurately predict fibrin structure at these higher concentrations. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Cell survival was increased by the activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) but not by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These effects correlated with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced by these two classes of calcium channels. Antibodies to BDNF (which block intracellular signaling by BDNF, but not by nerve growth factor, NT3, or NT4/5) reduced the survival of cortical neurons and reversed the VSCC-mediated increase in survival. Thus, endogenous BDNF is a trophic factor for cortical neurons whose expression is VSCC-regulated and that functions in the VSCC-dependent survival of these neurons.",

      "abstract": "We have systematically optimized the concentrations of 20 components of a previously published serum-free medium (Brewer and Cotman, Brain Res 494: 65-74, 1989) for survival of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons after 4 days in culture. This serum-free medium supplement, B27, produced neuron survival above 60%, independent of plating density above 160 plated cells/mm2. For isolated cells (< 100 cells/mm2), survival at 4 days was still above 45%, but could be rescued to the 60% level at 40 cells/mm2 by simply applying a coverslip on top of the cells. This suggests a need for additional trophic factors. High survival was achieved with osmolarity lower than found in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), and by reducing cysteine and glutamine concentrations and by the elimination of toxic ferrous sulphate found in DME/F12. Neurobasal is a new medium that incorporates these modifications to DMEM. In B27/Neurobasal, glial growth is reduced to less than 0.5% of the nearly pure neuronal population, as judged by immunocytochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuron-specific enolase. Excellent long-term viability is achieved after 4 weeks in culture with greater than 90% viability for cells plated at 640/mm2 and greater than 50% viability for cells plated at 160/mm2. Since the medium also supports the growth of neurons from embryonic rat striatum, substantia nigra, septum, and cortex, and neonatal dentate gyrus and cerebellum (Brewer, in preparation), support for other neuron types is likely. B27/Neurobasal should be useful for in vitro studies of neuronal toxicology, pharmacology, electrophysiology, gene expression, development, and effects of growth factors and hormones.",

      "abstract": "Primary embryonic hippocampal neurons can develop morphologically and functionally in culture but do not survive more than a few weeks. It has been reported that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes the survival of and neurite elongation from fetal hippocampal neurons. We report that bFGF, in a dose-dependent manner, can induce the survival (50 pg to 1 ng/ml) and proliferation (10-20 ng/ml) of embryonic hippocampal progenitor neurons in vitro. In serum-free medium containing high concentrations of bFGF, neurons not only proliferated (4-day doubling time) and differentiated morphologically but also could be passaged and grown as continuous cell lines. The neuronal nature of the proliferating cells was positively established by immunostaining with several different neuron-specific markers and by detailed ultrastructural analyses. The proliferative effect of bFGF was used to generate nearly pure neuronal cell cultures that can be passaged, frozen, thawed, and cultured again. Neurons have been maintained &gt; 5 months in culture. The ability to establish long-term primary neuronal cultures offers the possibility that clonal lines of distinct neuronal cell types may be isolated from specific areas of the central nervous system. Such long-term neuronal cultures should prove valuable in studying neurons at the individual cell level and also in exploring interactions between neurons in vitro. The observed dose dependence raises the possibility that cell survival and proliferation in vivo may be influenced by different levels of bFGF.",

The response was unaffected by antiserum to NGF. Rapid outgrowth also occurred when sympathetic neurons were plated onto polylysine-coated surfaces that had been exposed to serum-free medium conditioned by corneal endothelial cells (CMSF). A response was seen even when the neurons were cultured without serum. When plated onto a polylysine-coated dish treated with CMSF over half its surface, only the neurons on the treated half extended neurites. The active factor in CMSF was destroyed by trypsin, acid (pH 1.6), base (pH 12.7), or heating to 80 degrees C; it was stable to heating to 60 degrees C, collagenase, deoxyribonuclease, and neuraminidase. The factor elutes just after the void volume of a Sepharose 6B column.

Material from this fraction was inactivated by heparinase, but not chondroitinase ABC, implying that a heparin sulfate proteoglycan is essential for the factor's activity. Inactivation by contaminants in the heparinase preparation was ruled out. Further purification indicated that the active factor may exist as an aggregate containing a heparin sulfate proteoglycan and other molecules. CMSF also promoted neurite outgrowth by other types of neurons. Furthermore, a variety of cell types were shown to produce factors similar to that in CMSF.",

One such supplement is a protein termed the ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) which is present at very high concentrations within intraocular tissues that contain the same muscle cells innervated by ciliary ganglionic neurons in vivo. We describe here the purification of chick eye CNTF by a 2½‐day procedure involving the processing of intraocular tissue extract sequentially through DE52 ion‐exchange chromatography, membrane ultrafiltration‐concentration, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gradient electrophoresis. An aqueous extract of the tissue from 300 eyes will yield about 10–20 μg of biologically active, electrophoretically pure CNTF with a specific activity of 7.5 × 10 6 trophic units/mg protein. Purified CNTF has an M r of 20,400 daltons and an isoelectric point of about 5, as determined by analytical gel electrophoresis. In addition to supporting the survival of ciliary ganglion neurons, purified CNTF also supports the 24‐h survival of cultured neurons from certain chick and rodent sensory and sympathetic ganglia. CNTF differs from mouse submaxillary nerve growth factor (NGF) in molecular weight, isoelectric point, inability to be inactivated by antibodies to NGF, ability to support the in vitro survival of the ciliary ganglion neurons, and inability to support that of 8‐day chick embryo dorsal root ganglionic neurons. Thus, CNTF represents the first purified neuronotrophic factor which addresses parasympathetic cholinergic neurons.",

Purified laminin from both mouse and rat sources, as well as a partially purified polyornithine-binding neurite promoting factor (PNPF-1) from rat Schwannoma cells all stimulate neurite production from these neurons. Laminin and PNPF-1 are also potent stimulators of neurite growth from cultured neurons obtained from other peripheral as well as central neural tissues, specifically avian sympathetic and sensory ganglia and spinal cord, optic tectum, neural retina, and telencephalon, as well as from sensory ganglia of the neonatal mouse and hippocampal, septal, and striatal tissues of the fetal rat. A quantitative in vitro bioassay method using ciliary neurons was used to (a) measure and compare the specific neurite-promoting activities of these agents, (b) confirm that during the purification of laminin, the neurite-promoting activity co-purifies with the laminin protein, and (c) compare the influences of antilaminin antibodies on the neurite-promoting activity of laminin and PNPF-1. We conclude that laminin and PNPF-1 are distinct macromolecules capable of expressing their neurite-promoting activities even when presented in nanogram amounts.
