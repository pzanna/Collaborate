    "abstract": "Abstract Nucleus uvaeformis (Uva), previously identified as a component of song control circuitry in songbirds, and nucleus dorsolateralis posterior thalami, pars caudalis (DLPc) in pigeon, were compared with respect to their relative positions in the dorsolateral part of the posterior thalamus, their cell types, and their afferent and efferent projections. Both nuclei are closely related to the habenulointerpeduncular tract, have similar cell types, and receive a dense projection from deep layers of the optic tectum, predominantly ipsilaterally, and a distinct projection from the dorsal column and external cuneate nuclei, predominantly contralaterally. Recordings of multiple unit activity evoked by visual and somatosensory stimuli were used to guide injections of tracer into either DLPc or Uva, and the projections to the telencephalon were charted. Both nuclei were found to have a major terminal field in the medial part of the ipsilateral neostriatum intermedium (NI), known as nucleus interfacialis (NIf) in songbirds, and a minor terminal field in the roof of the neostriatum caudale (NC). In pigeon, the DLPc terminations in NC were within a region known as neostriatum dorsale (Nd), and, in male songbirds, the Uva terminations were in the high vocal center (HVC). Recordings of visual and somatosensory evoked activity were then used to guide injections of tracer into NI, and the afferent and efferent projections were again compared in pigeon and songbirds. The projections from either DLPc or Uva were confirmed, and terminal fields were observed either in Nd in pigeon, the dorsolateral part of NC in female songbirds, or HVC in male songbirds. Injections of tracer into either Nd or HVC confirmed their sources of afferents in DLPc or Uva, respectively, and in NI, but there was incomplete overlap of the distribution of retrogradely labelled cells in NI and the terminal fields of DLPc or Uva. It is concluded that DLPc and Uva are comparable nuclei having similar afferent and efferent projections relaying visual and somatosensory information to the telencephalon. The possible role of this information in vocal control is discussed. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "title": "Differential effects of global versus local testosterone on singing behavior and its underlying neural substrate",
    "abstract": "Significance Steroid hormones coordinate multiple behaviors into a functional response (reproduction, stress). It is easy to assess such coordination when comparing actions in different target tissues but is more of a challenge when numerous functions are combined in the brain. Our study illustrates how steroids act on distinct cell groups to regulate separate components of a testosterone-dependent behavior, learned birdsong. Testosterone in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) increased singing but not optimal song performance. Moreover, testosterone in the POM enhanced volumes of forebrain regions that control song, presumably reflecting the effect of activity-dependent plasticity. Thus, optimal performance of a complex, learned behavior requires testosterone at multiple loci, and activity and/or transsynaptic influences may stimulate forebrain neuroplasticity.",
