# Logging âœ… COMPLETED

## Description

Implement structured JSON logging for all MCP server events to improve observability.

## Subtasks

- [x] Select a logging framework (e.g., `logrus` or built-in `log` with JSON formatter).
- [x] Instrument MCP server to log key events: agent registration, task dispatch, completion, and errors.
- [x] Define log schema: fields should include `timestamp`, `level`, `component`, `event`, `task_id`, `context_id`, `details`.
- [x] Implement logging in MCP: ensure logs are JSON-formatted.
- [x] Add Python client logging in `mcp_client.py` for gRPC calls.
- [x] Write integration tests to verify log output format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Logs are output as valid JSON.
- Logs contain required fields and can be ingested by log analysis tools.
