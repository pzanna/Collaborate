# ðŸ§­ Roadmap: Multi-AI Research System Improvements

## Phase 1: Foundation Hardening

### Goals
- Standardise protocols
- Improve logging/debugging
- Establish reliable agent execution

### Tasks
- [ ] Update MCP `.proto` with task envelope, timeout, retry fields
- [ ] Implement structured JSON logging in MCP server
- [ ] Add task timeouts and failure tracking
- [ ] Add agent capability registration
- [ ] Update RM system prompt for new schema

---

## Phase 2: Intelligence Scaling

### Goals
- Improve performance with parallelism
- Smarter Research Manager task planning

### Tasks
- [ ] Enable parallel task dispatch in MCP server
- [ ] Implement task dependency tracking (parent/child)
- [ ] Teach RM AI to decompose complex tasks
- [ ] Collate parallel results through ReasonerAgent

---

## Phase 3: Memory & Cost Optimisation

### Goals
- Persist context
- Control token and compute usage

### Tasks
- [ ] Enhance MemoryAgent with storage + query
- [ ] Teach RM AI to avoid redundant agent calls
- [ ] Add cost-aware decision making to prompt
- [ ] Store context traces with context_id

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Integration & Visual Tools

### Goals
- Increase system observability
- Add task viewer and prompt planner

### Tasks
- [ ] Build live task viewer UI in React
- [ ] Add MCP session visualisation (task graph)
- [ ] Expose RM internal plan as readable summary
- [ ] Add user control over RM decisions (optional)
