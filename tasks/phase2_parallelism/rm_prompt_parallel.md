# RM Prompt Parallelism

## Description
Enhance the Research Manager AI system prompt and logic to request parallel processing for complex tasks.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Update system prompt to include `parallelism` guidelines.
- [ ] Teach RM AI to analyse task complexity and set `parallelism` accordingly.
- [ ] Test prompt behavior with mock agents: verify correct parallel task counts.
- [ ] Document prompt changes with examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
- RM AI system prompt contains parallelism instructions.
- RM AI sends correct `parallelism` values in tasks.
