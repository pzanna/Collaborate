# Task Fan-out âœ… COMPLETED

## Description

Enable parallel dispatch of subtasks to multiple agent instances for improved throughput.

## Subtasks

- [x] Update MCP server to support fan-out: submit one logical task to multiple agents.
- [x] Define a `parallelism` field in the task envelope.
- [x] Implement fan-out logic in MCP server: spawn sub-tasks with distinct `task_id`s.
- [x] Collect partial responses and aggregate results.
- [x] Write tests demonstrating parallel execution and aggregation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- MCP server splits tasks correctly according to `parallelism`.
- Partial and final results from multiple agents are aggregated accurately.
